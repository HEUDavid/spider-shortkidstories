Everybody wants to see the baby.\u00a0 Man, that baby has got it made. They all decided to sit outside on the porch for a while and enjoy the beautiful weather. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me, all that house cleaning gone to waste.\u00a0 Someone needs to go inside and appreciate how hard I worked for this visit.\u00a0 Everyone\u2019s gathering around little Angee now, and this baby loves every minute of it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame her; I would too.\u00a0 So many arms to conquer, and so little time to do it; life comes at you fast.</p><p>I declare that baby can \u201ccoo\u201d and giggle on key.\u00a0 Oh, why couldn\u2019t that be me?\u00a0 It\u2019s just not fair.\u00a0 She hasn\u2019t done anything to deserve all that attention.\u00a0 Oh, oh, something\u2019s wrong, little Angee isn\u2019t giggling anymore.\u00a0 And I notice the relatives slowly passing her from person to person trying to get her calm.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re talking in some ridiculous baby voice while asking her, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong precious?\u201d\u00a0 Why are they doing that?\u00a0 They know she can\u2019t answer them.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re passing her back to her mother, and she too asks the same question.\u00a0 Like me, little Angee must be tired of hearing it because she got even louder.</p><p>My aunt makes the decision that she must be wet, so she proceeds to stick her finger in her diaper.\u00a0 Yuck!\u00a0 How would she feel if someone did that to her in front of everyone?\u00a0 How embarrassing!\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Angee liked it either because she raised her voice a little louder.\u00a0 My mother asked my aunt if she was hungry.\u00a0 Well, she wasn\u2019t hungry; she had been fed just before they came over, and the finger in the diaper proved she wasn\u2019t wet.</p><p>My aunt was somewhat flustered by now and once more asked, \u201cHoney, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0 Little Angee kept right on crying.\u00a0 I begin to notice how everyone started making excuses as they edged their way pass me to go inside.\u00a0 I listened as some said they needed to get some water, use the bathroom; or it\u2019s getting a warm.\u201d\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t warm; it was February, and the people that went to the bathroom didn\u2019t come back.\u00a0 I guess any excuse was a good reason to get away from all that crying.\u00a0 Angee\u2019s mom stated pacing back and forth with Angee trying to get her quiet.\u00a0 I begin to feel really sorry for little Angee.\u00a0 It seemed as long as she was happy and giggling everyone wanted to be around her and hold her.\u00a0 However, the minute things started going wrong, which led to her crying and becoming fussy they deserted her.</p><p>Wow, being a baby isn\u2019t as wonderful as I thought it would be.\u00a0 At least, I could talk, express how I was feeling, and let people know how I felt.\u00a0 Little Angee couldn\u2019t do that.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t let them know how she felt, why she was crying, whether or not she was hungry or didn\u2019t like what they were doing to her.</p><p>Soon only a couple of people were left on the porch with my Aunt.\u00a0 Little Angee was calming down, so I thought I would ask my aunt what was wrong with her.\u00a0 My aunt told me; sometimes too much attention isn\u2019t good for you.\u00a0 She said, all the passing around irritated her, and crying was Angee\u2019s way of letting them know she wasn\u2019t happy with it</p><p>\u201dLittle Angee had just taught me a couple of valuable lessons.\u00a0 One, find a way to make those you care about, and care about you listen to what\u2019s bothering you.\u00a0 I would find a way to help my mother understand what I was going through.\u00a0 No, I wasn\u2019t going to resort to crying as my little cousin did to get my point across, but it\u2019s important that she is aware of how I feel.\u00a0 I will find a way.\u00a0 Second and the most important lesson, I am so blessed to be who I am.\u00a0 I never realized this or appreciated it before. \u00a0Unlike little Angee, I am able to express how I felt, and it\u2019s time I started doing that more often.\u00a0 I am so glad to be me.</p>"}
