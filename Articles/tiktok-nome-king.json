He had carelessly bitten his tongue at breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and stamped around in his underground palace in a way that rendered him very disagreeable.</p><p>It so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man,visited the Nome King to ask a favor. Tiktok lived in the Land of Oz, and although he was an active and important person, he was made entirely of metal. Machinery within him, something like the works of a clock, made him move; other machinery made him talk; still other machinery made him think.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image20.jpg'></img><p>Although so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from perfect. Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech works, and his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to run down at a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some of his parts were wearing out, through much use, and just now his thought machinery needed repair. The skillful little Wizard of Oz had tinkered with Tiktok\u2019s thoughts without being able to get them properly regulated, so he had advised the Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King and secure a new set of springs, which would render his thoughts more elastic and responsive.</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you say to the Nome King,\u201d warned the Wizard. \u201cHe has a bad temper and the least little thing makes him angry.\u201d</p><p>Tiktok promised, and the Wizard wound his machinery and set him walking in the direction of the Nome King\u2019s dominions, just across the desert from the Land of Oz. He ran down just as he reached the entrance to the underground palace, and there Kaliko, the Nome King\u2019s Chief Steward, found him and wound him up again.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the King,\u201d said Tiktok, in his jerky voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d remarked Kaliko, \u201cit may be safe for a cast-iron person like you to face his Majesty this morning; but you must announce yourself, for should I show my face inside the jewel-studded cavern where the King is now raving, I\u2019d soon look like a dish of mashed potatoes, and be of no further use to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a-fraid,\u201d said Tiktok.</p><p>\u201cThen walk in and make yourself at home,\u201d answered Kaliko, and threw open the door of the King\u2019s cavern.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image21.jpg'></img><p>Tiktok promptly walked in and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom he said: \u201cGood morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my thought-works and a new cog-wheel for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout it, your Maj-es-ty?\u201d</p><p>The Nome King growled a menacing growl and his eyes were red with rage.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you enter my presence?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cI dare an-y-thing,\u201d said Tiktok. \u201cI\u2019m not a-fraid of a fat Nome.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image22.jpg'></img><p>This was true, yet an unwise speech. Had Tiktok\u2019s thoughts been in good working order he would have said something else. The angry Nome King quickly caught up his heavy mace and hurled it straight at Tiktok. When it struck the metal man\u2019s breast, the force of the blow burst the bolts which held the plates of his body together and they clattered to the floor in a score of pieces. Hundreds and hundreds of wheels, pins, cogs and springs filled the air like a cloud and then rattled like hail upon the floor.</p><p>Where Tiktok had stood was now only a scrap-heap and the Nome King was so amazed by the terrible effect of his blow that he stared in wonder.</p><p>His Majesty\u2019s anger quickly cooled. He remembered that the Clockwork Man was a favorite subject of the powerful Princess, Ozma of Oz, who would be sure to resent Tiktok\u2019s ruin.</p><p>\u201cToo bad! too bad!\u201d he muttered, regretfully. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I made junk of the fellow. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be,\u201d remarked Kaliko, who now ventured to enter the room. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a war on your hands when Ozma hears of this, and the chances are you will lose your throne and your kingdom.\u201d</p><p>The Nome King turned pale, for he loved to rule the Nomes and did not know of any other way to earn a living in case Ozma fought and conquered him.</p><p>\u201cDo\u2014do you think Ozma will be angry?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it,\u201d said Kaliko. \u201cAnd she has the right to be. You\u2019ve made scrap-iron of her favorite.\u201d</p><p>The King groaned.</p><p>\u201cSweep him up and throw the rubbish into the black pit,\u201d he commanded; and then he shut himself up in his private den and for days would see no one, because he was so ashamed of his unreasoning anger and so feared the results of his rash act.</p><p>Kaliko swept up the pieces, but he did not throw them into the black pit. Being a clever and skillful mechanic he determined to fit the pieces together again.</p><p>No man ever faced a greater puzzle; but it was interesting work and Kaliko succeeded. When he found a spring or wheel worn or imperfect, he made a new one.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image23.jpg'></img><p>Within two weeks, by working steadily night and day, the Chief Steward completed his task and put the three sets of clockworks and the last rivet into Tiktok\u2019s body. He then wound up the motion machinery, and the Clockwork Man walked up and down the room as naturally as ever. Then Kaliko wound up the thought works and the speech regulator and said to Tiktok:</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said the Clockwork Man. \u201cYou have done a ve-ry good job, Kal-i-ko, and saved me from de-struc-tion. Much o-bliged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d replied the Chief Steward. \u201cI quite enjoyed the work.\u201d</p><p>Just then the Nome King\u2019s gong sounded, and Kaliko rushed away through the jewel-studded cavern and into the den where the King had hidden, leaving the doors ajar.</p><p>\u201cKaliko,\u201d said the King, in a meek voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been shut up here long enough to repent bitterly the destruction of Tiktok. Of course Ozma will have revenge, and send an army to fight us, but we must take our medicine. One thing comforts me: Tiktok wasn\u2019t really a live person; he was only a machine man, and so it wasn\u2019t very wicked to stop his clockworks. I couldn\u2019t sleep nights, at first, for worry; but there\u2019s no more harm in smashing a machine man than in breaking a wax doll. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am too humble to think in the presence of your Majesty,\u201d said Kaliko.</p><p>\u201cThen get me something to eat,\u201d commanded the King, \u201cfor I\u2019m nearly starved. Two roasted goats, a barrel of cakes and nine mince pies will do me until dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>Kaliko bowed and hurried away to the royal kitchen, forgetting Tiktok, who was wandering around in the outer cavern. Suddenly the Nome King looked up and saw the Clockwork Man standing before him, and at the sight the monarch\u2019s eyes grew big and round and he fell a-trembling in every limb.</p><p>\u201cAway, grim Shadow!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not here, you know; you\u2019re only a hash of cogwheels and springs, lying at the bottom of the black pit. Vanish, thou Vision of the demolished Tiktok, and leave me in peace\u2014for I have bitterly repented!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image24.jpg'></img><p>\u201cThen beg my pardon,\u201d said Tiktok in a gruff voice, for Kaliko had forgotten to oil the speech works.</p><p>But the sound of a voice coming from what he thought a mere vision was too much for the Nome King\u2019s shaken nerves. He gave a yell of fear and rushed from the room. Tiktok followed, so the King bolted through the corridors on a swift run and bumped against Kaliko, who was returning with a tray of things to eat. The sound of the breaking dishes, as they struck the floor, added to the King\u2019s terror and he yelled again and dashed into a great cavern where a thousand Nomes were at work hammering metal.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image25.jpg'></img><p>\u201cLook out! Here comes a phantom clockwork man!\u201d screamed the terrified monarch, and every Nome dropped his tools and made a rush from the cavern, knocking over their King in their mad flight and recklessly trampling upon his prostrate fat body. So, when Tiktok came into the cavern, there was only the Nome King left, and he was rolling upon the rocky floor and howling for mercy, with his eyes fast shut so that he could not see what he was sure was a dreadful phantom that was coming straight toward him.</p><p>\u201cIt oc-curs to me,\u201d said Tiktok calmly, \u201cthat your Maj-es-ty is act-ing like a ba-by I am not a phan-tom. A phan-tom is unreal, while I am the real thing.\u201d</p><p>The King rolled over, sat up and opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I smash you to pieces?\u201d he asked in trembling tones.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tiktok.</p><p>\u201cThen you are nothing but a junk-heap, and this form in which you now appear cannot be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, though,\u201d declared Tiktok. \u201cKal-i-ko picked up my piec-es and put me to-geth-er a-gain. I\u2019m as good as new, and perhaps bet-ter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true, your Majesty,\u201d added Kaliko, who now made his appearance, \u201cand I hope you will forgive me for mending Tiktok. He was quite broken up, after you smashed him, and I found it almost as hard a job to match his pieces as to pick turnips from gooseberry bushes. But I did it,\u201d he added proudly.</p><p>\u201cYou are forgiven,\u201d announced the Nome King, rising to his feet and drawing a long breath. \u201cI will raise your wages one specto a year, and Tiktok shall return to the Land of Oz loaded with jewels for the Princess Ozma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is all right,\u201d said Tiktok. \u201cBut what I want to know is, why did you hit me with your mace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was angry,\u201d admitted the King. \u201cWhen I am angry I always do something that I am sorry for afterward. So I have firmly resolved never to get angry again; unless\u2014unless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what, your Majesty?\u201d inquired Kaliko.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image26.jpg'></img><p>\u201cUnless something annoys me,\u201d said the Nome King. And then he went to his treasure-chamber to get the jewels for Princess Ozma of Oz.</p>"}
