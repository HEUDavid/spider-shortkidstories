Elva lay on the shop floor, nodding her head, happily talking to her chosen guinea pig.</p><p>\u201cI love this one. Look, look mum, she\u2019s nibbling me.\u201d The vanilla and caramel coloured guinea pig tasted one of Elva\u2019s fingers while making little happy noises: \u201cwheek, wheek, wheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwh, she sounds lovely. Isn\u2019t she lovely mum!\u201d Elva spread herself out on her stomach, rolling around and peeckabooing with the guinea pig.</p><p>\u201cYes Elva, she\u2019s lovely. Is she the one? You decide.\u201d Elva\u2019s mum, Sigrid, hunkered down beside Elva.</p><p>Elva mimicked the happy noise of the guinea pig: \u201cwheek, wheek, wheek, yes, you\u2019re going to be my pet and I\u2019m going to care for you, a love of a lot.\u201d Elva giggled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right; you\u2019re going to care for her.\u201d Sigrid repeated while letting the little guinea pig nibble her too.</p><p>\u201cI will mum, every day.\u201d Elva pushed her face forward and opened her eyes extra wide to show her mum the seriousness of her responsibility.</p><p>\u201cSeveral times a day,\u201d her mum reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, mum,\u201d Elva agreed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sigrid stood up. \u201cShe\u2019s cute and lovely and also lots of work and responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Elva lifted herself off the floor to calm her mum down with a hug.</p><p>\u201cRemember, a pet is for life,\u201d Sigrid said embraced in one of Elva\u2019s love squeezes.</p><p>\u201cYes mum, I know.\u00a0 I\u2019m a big girl now, I\u2019m seven and I\u2019m ready for a pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, and you know your dad, he is not going to help at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he made that very clear. \u201cAnimals belong in the outdoors. All animals!\u201d Elva mimicked her dad but in a happy voice so as not to scare the guinea pig.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that awful,\u201d Elva said to her guinea pig. Mum laughed. \u201cWe can\u2019t change other people Elva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elva sighed and shrugged her left shoulders up and the right down, reversed and then two quick rowing stretches with both arms. Elva loved living in her body and was never fully still.</p><p>The animal caretaker came and asked if Elva had made her choice and opened the cage to let Elva pick exactly the one she wanted. He showed her how to pick up her guinea pig first.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you reach under the belly, then, place your other hand under the back legs as you lift the guinea pig.\u201d</p><p>Elva did exactly what she had been shown to do and the guinea pig stood still and let Elva scoop her up while looking at Elva with her cute little face. She nuzzled into Elva\u2019s neck and Elva giggled in delight.</p><p>\u201cLove, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll call you, what do you think of your new name, Love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWheek, wheek, wheek, wheek.\u201d\u00a0 Love kept nuzzling her neck. \u201cI think she loves her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handle her with love, gentleness and great care. I predict you\u2019ll be best friends,\u201d the animal caretaker said. Elva smiled.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. I\u2019m a natural guinea pig lover.\u201d</p><p>Mum paid for Love and all the bits and pieces she would need. Mum rang dad and when he came, mum packed the cage, food and toys into the boot of the car while Elva settled Love into a box full of holes.</p><p>\u201cJust for safety, holding her might seem like a good idea, but this way you can be sure she\u2019ll get to her new home without escaping,\u201d the animal caretaker said. Elva promised Love it was only a short ride home and much faster than walking.</p><p>At home, Elva had already made space for Love\u2019s cage. She made a little enclosure by placing books and toys in a circle on the floor and let Love out to discover while she fixed up the cage.</p><p>She put old newspapers at the bottom, then hay and straw. She filled the water bottle and hung it between the cage bars, she added a salt bar and some yummy fruit treats and a wooden house with a ladder and a bowl of dry food on the roof of the house.</p><p>\u201cWow, I wouldn\u2019t mind living in there,\u201d said her older brother Jay as he came home, eager to be introduced to the new family member.</p><p>\u201cLove, this is my brother Jay, Jay meet Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Jay.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a she.\u201d Elva made the important stuff clear, but Jay protested.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s love, then she\u2019s both a she and a he. Love doesn\u2019t have a preference.\u201d</p><p>Elva loved her brother. \u201cOk, you can call Love male, and I call her female. After thinking she added: \u201cIf I love her more than I love you, am I a bad sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because love can\u2019t be measured.\u201d Jay picked up Love and cuddled her.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means love is always love, there is no less or more, it\u2019s all just love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when I look at Love and my heart is swelling with love, and when I look at you and get a warm feeling in my body, it\u2019s all love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, clever sister.\u201d Jay gave Love to her and ruffled her hair. She was very clever.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Elva loved looking after Love. Love was her new best friend. They played every morning before Elva went to school. They played in the afternoon when she came home from school. They had a last cuddle before Elva went to bed. Elva\u2019s heart had opened wide since Love came into her life.</p><p>\u201cThe power of Love is love.\u201d\u00a0 Elva\u2019s mood changed with Love, instead of angry and on the edge, she became calm and centred.</p><p>\u201cAll credit to you, Love,\u201d she said.</p><p>Elva changed her twice a week which was aplenty for Love to always have a clean and snug home.</p><p>Elva invited her friends to meet Love when she had settled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so cute,\u201d her friend Lollo said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lovely, yes you are,\u201d Mia talked silly with Love.</p><p>\u201cHahaha, did you hear, she purrs, a guinea pig purr,\u201d her friend Roe said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she saying?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>\u201cShe loves all of you,\u201d Elva translated.</p><p>\u201cWe love you too, they replied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d Elva said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d her friends chorused.</p><p>\u201cBy the way you look at her, by the way you hold her, by the way you talk to her and by the way you feed her. Here, try to give her some spinach. She loves spinach.\u201d Elva grabbed a bunch from the tray she kept prepared for Love and gave to her friends to feed Love.</p><p>They played with Love until it was time for her friends to go home. They hadn\u2019t done any of the stuff they used to do before Love came to live with Elva, but no one minded.</p><p>\u201cCan we come tomorrow again, please?\u201d All her friends made heart signs with their hands in Love\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYes, Elva sighed happily, but not on Saturday, we\u2019re going to my cousins on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019ll look after Love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d her friends chorused again which made Elva giggle. She loved telling her friends all about her new friend and hope they wouldn\u2019t be jealous. There was no need to be jealous as Love made Elva expand and grow. She wanted everyone to feel the same.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Elva showed her pink guinea pig carrier case. She had made it cosy for Love with scrunched up newspaper to hide in, hay and some nibbly fruit and nut bars. She couldn\u2019t wait to bring Love to meet her cousins. Laughter bubbled out of her, she loved her sound of love and thanked Love for teaching her how to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d her friends laughed with her. Elva thanked them all.</p><p>\u201cYes, lovely for little Love.\u201d Elva twirled around, adding her trademark pushing out of the stomach. Happiness had made a home in Elva and she was showing it off.</p><p>Her cousins did like Love, they loved her so much they wanted to keep her, or at least get their own guinea pig.</p><p>\u201cA pet is for life, not just for fun,\u201d her cousin\u2019s parents said.</p><p>\u201cLife is fun, it\u2019s even funnier with Love,\u201d Elva spoke up for her cousins. She wished for everyone to have a little Love in their life. After a long day\u2019s play, Elva was exhausted, but still insisted on her night time ritual with Love.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute, I\u2019d love to let you sleep in my bed, but I won\u2019t, I\u2019ll let you fall asleep on my lap instead,\u201d Elva said to Love when they came home. She stroked her little body while looking into those full of love eyes and fell asleep. Elva\u2019s mum brought Love to her house and Elva to her bed.</p><p>\u201cSee you Love, see you tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWheek, wheek, wheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwh.\u201d Elva was totally in love.</p><p>The next day, Elva woke up with a sniffle. Her mum gave her extra vitamins in the form of fruit and said her body would do the rest of the healing work automatically and naturally.</p><p>She played and talked with Love before going to school. She always changed her on a Tuesday evening and a Saturday morning. She had a special bin for Love, which was pink too, the colour of love.</p><p>She included Love in every story she wrote in school. She wrote poems about her too, which she was happy to recite for the class, even if they would never win an award. She was in love with Love and everything she wrote was beautiful and wonderful.</p><p>In geography she informed everyone that guinea pigs originally came from South America, and it was part of their culture to eat guinea pigs.</p><p>\u201cI would never eat guinea pigs, they are little love starters, \u201cElva said, surprising the teacher.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel it,\u201d Elva answered truthfully.</p><p>The teacher allowed her to bring in Love for show and tell one week. Elva\u2019s mum brought in Love in her carrier after lunch and Elva talked about Love like she had never talked about anything. Love had transformed Elva and she wanted to make her class understand that a guinea pig was more than a pet, it was a friend.</p><p>\u201cNot as good as your real friends.\u201d The teacher wanted to keep it real, but Elva was more real than she had ever been in her whole life.</p><p>\u201cLove is my best friend, just like all my best friends, there is no one better, but I would die without Love.\u201d Elva perspired and her face turned red.</p><p>\u201cNo you would not, it\u2019s a pet, not a human, it\u2019s not good to exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Elva put Love into her cage, closed it gently, lifted the cage and began to walk, she continued past her desk and out the door.</p><p>\u201cElva, come back, we haven\u2019t finished,\u201d the teacher called.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d she growled and ran out the door, clutching the carrier while speeding down the street.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best teacher I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Elva told Love. We\u2019re a good combination.\u201d</p><p>She told her mum what the teacher had said and her mum agreed adults could sometimes be very insensitive.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people think they know all about love but most are still learning, Love is teaching you more than school can in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bless you mum for you are the best.\u201d\u00a0 Love bubbled to the surface of Elva.</p><p>Together, Elva and mum set up the adventure track for Love in the living room and let Love run free.</p><p>The next day her mum came with her to school and told the teacher Love was indeed a friend and the thought of living without someone you love can feel like dying. The teacher apologised to Elva, saying she had been uncaring and hardhearted in her view of love.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get a guinea pig, they share their love until you\u2019re all loved up.\u201d Elva shook hands with the teacher, before hugging her mum and telling her loudly \u201cI love you\u201d before giving Love, who had come to grant her forgiveness too, to her mum to bring home.</p><p>She scratched her arms but paid no attention to why. In the afternoon, she invited her friends for a guinea pig picnic. She prepared a basket of food, for Love too, and put her in a special lead for guinea pigs and when they found a good grassy spot Elva let Love run free.\u00a0 Love loved the grass, she was bubbling and purring and wheeking, she was also chutting and whining. They all ate together, and then they took turn snuggling with Love. Elva sneezed and scratched her arms where little red bumps were now visible.\u00a0 She pulled the blanket over her arms and relaxed in the sun, cuddling with Love.</p><p>People passing commented on their love union, saying they looked lovely together.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, we\u2019re both lovely and we\u2019ll be together forever and ever.</p><p>She sneezed and scratched her arms again.</p><p>\u201cSummer colds are the worst,\u201d she said.\u00a0 At home she covered up with long sleeved shirts and when her mum asked if she wasn\u2019t hot she said she must have got a summer cold and sneezed loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou do look like you\u2019ve got a bad dose,\u201d her mum said and looked at her more closely. There was no hiding the red eyes and runny nose. Elva didn\u2019t want to go to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t believe in taking medication for colds and neither do you, mum.\u201d\u00a0 Elva was right. Her mum let her stay at home to rest and recuperate. Elva played with Love for three days and those days were the best in her life, she could feel herself become Love, become bigger than herself, or smaller, until there was no boundaries, she was a guinea pig too, she played and snuggled and smooched and imprinted Love in her heart forever.</p><p>When her face became blotchy and her nose like a tap, her mum brought her to the doctor.</p><p>She knew what the doctor was going to say, Love had already told her.</p><p>\u201cElva, you\u2019re allergic to guinea pigs, you\u2019re allergic to Love.\u201d</p><p>She knew it. \u201cOK, just give me the medicine, I\u2019ll take anything you say,\u201d she announced, proud for being brave in a difficult situation.</p><p>The doctor made a sad face and said sorry. Mum said sorry too.</p><p>\u201cNO\u2026there\u2019s no sorry.\u201d Elva\u2019s face dropped and her body slumped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there is no medicine. The only cure is to get rid of the guinea pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of\u2026.get rid of\u2026Love\u2026NEVER!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand how you must feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t. Are you seven? Do you have a guinea pig who\u2019s your best friend in the whole wide world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, you don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m not going to get rid of Love. Thank you and good bye.\u201d</p><p>She got up, banged the door, ran out, continued across the road without looking, then through the park, along the canal, and all the way home. She packed Love into her carrier and ran down to the woods where she had built a retreat for her and Love.</p><p>There she poured her heart out.</p><p>\u201cYou are the best friend I have ever had, the best friend I will ever have. You always listen, you never give out, you don\u2019t care if I use the right word or a bad word. We do fun stuff together. We go on adventures. We watch movies together. We discover new things together: you taught me to eat and like spinach, celery and broccoli. Thanks Love.\u201d Elva hiccupped. You taught me to be calm, to slow down, to enjoy the little things, like cuddling and looking into your cute face.\u201d</p><p>She cried so hard she passed out with the effort.\u00a0 Her mum found her there. Elva had forgotten her mum knew of their retreat, she had invited her for being the best mum ever. Sigrid scooped Elva up into her arms.</p><p>\u201cMum, you\u2019ll save money if you let me keep Love, I\u2019ll never want to go to Zoo\u2019s, amusement parks, adventure lands or even the beach, as long as I have Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove has certainly taught you all about love, it sets you free, you need nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do need food.\u201d Elva gasped for air. She was all cried out.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I think Love is hungry, or isn\u2019t that what that sound means?\u201d Love made noises of hunger and Elva realised she couldn\u2019t run away from what was happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never let anyone take Love from me. NEVER! EVER!\u201d Elva trudged home with her mum wishing for a happy ending.</p><p>Later that evening someone rang the doorbell and a teenage girl introduced herself. Elva overheard their conversation and the loudest shatter ever made Elva jump.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that mum? That was the sound of my heart breaking.\u201d</p><p>The teenage girl came in to the living room where Elva sat on the floor, holding Love for dear life.</p><p>She sat down on the floor too.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Amor. I\u2019ve been looking for Love for such a long time.</p><p>Elva looked at her with tears streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You could have gotten any guinea pig and called her Love. Why do you have to take mine?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine, just as she was never yours, she\u2019s handed down by the power of love. Do you know what the power of guinea pig is?\u201d Amor asked. Elva shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s love, their special power is love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called her Love.\u201d Elva stopped crying.</p><p>\u201cYou are a special guinea pig lover.\u201d</p><p>Elva liked the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cI can see that you have taken the responsibility of her seriously, she is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Elva knew Love was beautiful, but Elva didn\u2019t look great. Her eyes were almost blood shot and she had to blink a few times to see properly.</p><p>\u201cSometimes a pet is not for life; sometimes you are given the power of the pet, which in this case is love, gentleness and responsibility much quicker, like you. I can see you\u2019re a very powerful girl, full of love.</p><p>Elva felt different, better in some strange way than she had a few months ago.</p><p>\u201cLetting go is a hard lesson to learn so early in life,\u201d Amor said, stretching her arms out for Love.</p><p>Elva kissed Love one last time and handed her over to the girl.</p><p>\u201cWill you call her Love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s her name and her power. Love started wheeking almost immediately. Elva broke into crying again, ripping and crushing crying.</p><p>Sigrid rushed in and hugged Elva close.</p><p>\u201cWe all miss Love,\u201d Elva\u2019s mum said, but sometimes the heart has to team up with the brain to reach the best decision for everyone. Love will live in your heart.\u201d</p><p>The girl hugged Elva in a group hug with Love before leaving.</p><p>\u201cYou are giving me the best gift in my whole life; it\u2019s not just a guinea pig, it\u2019s Love. I\u2019ll always remember you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Elva\u2019s heart didn\u2019t agree to give Love away, but her mum was right, her heart had teamed up with her brain.</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone else in my heart better make room, because my best friend is moving in.\u201d</p>"}
