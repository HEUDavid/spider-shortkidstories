Try it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>But Ivy Melissa wouldn\u2019t eat anything.</p><p>\u201cI HATE these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell young lady, if you won\u2019t eat, you might as well just go to your room,\u201d Dad said. \u201cCome back to the family when you\u2019re ready to eat and behave yourself!\u201d</p><p>So Ivy Melissa skipped lunch because she didn\u2019t believe what Mother told her: \u201cLasagna\u2019s only FAT NOODLES.\u201d</p><p>At suppertime, after everyone left, Dad said \u201cIvy Melissa, tomorrow we\u2019re going to the spaghetti factory and the chocolate factory, where you\u2019ll WATCH them make spaghetti and chocolate.\u00a0 Maybe THEN you\u2019ll believe what Mother said.\u201d</p><p>And so they went.</p><p>First to the spaghetti factory: Here Ivy Melissa was led through different rooms where flour was made into dough, and then pushed through the machines which made different forms of pasta. (spaghetti.)</p><p>\u201cLook Daddy, there\u2019s MY spaghetti; nice and long.\u00a0 But there are also LOTS of OTHER shapes of spaghetti coming out of the SAME MACHINE. They ALL come from the SAME DOUGH, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Honey. The dough which made YOUR spaghetti also made that lasagna and those other shapes.</p><p>\u201cNow I see Daddy. FAT NOODLES.\u00a0 All lasagna really is, is FAT NOODLES. But what about the chocolate cake?\u00a0 Is that the same chocolate as in chocolate kisses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I guess you\u2019ll have to see that for yourself, too. Let\u2019s go to the chocolate factory.\u201d</p><p>So off they went\u2026</p><p>Here they saw cocoa beans mashed into powder and mixed with other liquids and pumped into different shaped openings.\u00a0 Some turned out to be kisses, and some chocolate bars.\u00a0 There was also a pipe which kept the powder of the cocoa beans as a powder and pushed it into boxes for cake mixes and puddings.</p><p>\u201cLook Daddy. All of these DIFFERENT kinds of chocolate things came from the SAME cocoa beans.\u00a0 I guess they\u2019re ALL FAT NOODLES.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Ivy Melissa.\u00a0 Now, just because some kinds of foods and things LOOK different, INSIDE they\u2019re basically all FAT NOODLES.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand now, Daddy, and I guess you can say the same thing about PEOPLE.\u00a0 Even though people are different colors, shapes, sizes and religions, we\u2019re all STILL PEOPLE.</p><p>We\u2019re all FAT NOODLES!!!\u201d</p>"}
