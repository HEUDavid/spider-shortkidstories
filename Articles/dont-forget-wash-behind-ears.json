"<p>Mom and Dad had company over. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know much about the Robinsons, only that they didn\u2019t have any kids my age.\u00a0 If they did I wouldn\u2019t have had to chase the football when I practiced kickoffs, or we could have played Frisbee, or even had a water fight.\u00a0 Water fights were the best on hot summer days, and today was a scorcher.</p><p>Still, I couldn\u2019t waste my time sitting in the house.\u00a0 Summer was special-made for playing outside\u2013there were bugs to catch, creeks to splash through, trees to climb, and the sun was like a slow-motion replay of an out-of-the-park home run hit so high the ball might never come down on the other side of the stadium.\u00a0 Those last bits of twilight around 7:30, 8:00 were the greatest.\u00a0 Not a chance I would make it home in time for dinner.</p><p>I\u2019d munched on mulberries all afternoon, but after dark my stomach really started to rumble.\u00a0 I sailed through the tall grass, following backdoor porch lights like buoys, until I was home.\u00a0 The screen door clapped shut behind me, and my eyes landed on a wrapped up plate of ham and egg noodles with a slice of pineapple.\u00a0 While I was nuking the food Mom and Mrs. Robinson came into the kitchen for ice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much you\u2019ve grown,\u201d Mrs. Robinson told me, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cTallest of the whole team and still growing like a weed!\u201d Mom added proudly.</p><p>They laughed and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been hiding all day?\u201d Mom\u2019s friend asked.</p><p>I pulled the plate from the microwave a few seconds before it beeped.\u00a0 \u201cOutside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you look like you\u2019ve brought half the outside inside.\u00a0 You can\u2019t eat dinner like that.\u00a0 Go take a shower, and I\u2019ll keep your ham in the oven.\u201d\u00a0 Mom took the plate from my hand and pulled a leaf from my hair as I passed.</p><p>They laughed again, and from the hallway I heard Mrs. Robinson say, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wash behind your ears!\u201d</p><p>What did she mean?\u00a0 I thought about it all the way to the bathroom, feeling behind my ears gently at first then rubbing my fingers over the skin to see if anything came off.\u00a0 I leaned over the sink and looked in the mirror.\u00a0 I folded both ears forward, titled my head this way and that, but couldn\u2019t find anything.\u00a0 I thought my eyes might flip backwards inside my head if I looked any harder.</p><p>Just what was back there!?</p><p>Was it sweat?\u00a0 Dirt?\u00a0 Dried up mud from the creek?\u00a0 Another leaf like the one Mom pulled from my hair?</p><p>My imagination began to whirl.</p><p>Could it be a grass stain?\u00a0 Or a whole blade?\u00a0 Flakes of tree bark?\u00a0 A twig?\u00a0 A juicy, black mulberry, even?</p><p>I shucked my clothes on the tile and hopped in the shower.\u00a0 I wiggled around so the water pounded at the backs of my ears.\u00a0 Whatever was back there, it had to wash off.\u00a0 Then I\u2019d have a look at it.</p><p>What if it was a bug?\u00a0 An ant or a ladybug or a big old caterpillar?\u00a0 I watched the drain but nothing washed down.</p><p>Maybe it was something like a tick or burr holding on for dear life under the hard streams of water.\u00a0 Or a spider web?\u00a0 No, a creepy, crawly spider!\u00a0 No.\u00a0 A bird feather?\u00a0 Or a whole bird?</p><p>It could be anything!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Dont-Forget-to-Wash-Behind-Your-Ears-Illustration-Final-optimised.jpg'></img><p>I remembered the creek.\u00a0 Maybe a water strider or a minnow had jumped up behind my ear.\u00a0 No way.\u00a0 Whatever it was, it had to have an awful strong grip.\u00a0 It would need something like claws or talons.</p><p>I could almost feel it pulling at my ears.\u00a0 The scissor-sharp pincers of a cranky, old crab?\u00a0 Who knows where that creek went!</p><p>Could it be an octopus with eight huge arms and big, sticky suction cups?\u00a0 Or maybe, just maybe, it was a mermaid using magic to make itself invisible in the mirror!</p><p>What about a dragon?\u00a0 An enormous, saw-toothed dragon with thousands of blue scales so you couldn\u2019t see it flying down at you from the sky!\u00a0 It could be waiting behind me for a chance to breathe fire and burn my hair to a crisp!</p><p>I leaped out of the shower and checked the mirror again.\u00a0 I dried off and scrubbed extra hard behind my ears.\u00a0 Back downstairs Mom and Dad were sitting on the couch, reading.\u00a0 The Robinsons had gone home.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you see anything behind my ears?\u201d\u00a0 He slid down his glasses with a hmmm and an ooohh.</p><p>I bit my lip.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019d found it!</p><p>Then in a flash of goose bumps he ran his fingers over my neck to the top of my head where he tousled my hair and said, \u201cNot a thing.\u00a0 Clean as a whistle.\u201d</p><p>What a relief!</p><p>I ate my dinner and headed to bed.\u00a0 And as I crawled under the covers I wondered what I might bring home behind my ears tomorrow\u2026</p>"}
