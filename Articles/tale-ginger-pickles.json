The name over the window was \u201cGinger and Pickles.\u201d</p><p>It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls\u2014Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.</p><p>The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.</p><p>They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.</p><p>In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything\u2014except a few things that you want in a hurry\u2014like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops.</p><p>Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.</p><p>The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig13.jpg'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp14.png'></img><p>The shop was also patronized by mice\u2014only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.</p><p>Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.</p><p>\u201cI cannot bear,\u201d said he, \u201cto see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the same feeling about rats,\u201d replied Pickles, \u201cbut it would never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, they would go nowhere,\u201d replied Ginger gloomily.</p><p>(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not give credit.)</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp17.png'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig18.jpg'></img><p>Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.</p><p>Now the meaning of \u201ccredit\u201d is this\u2014when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it\u2014she says she will pay another time.</p><p>And Pickles makes a low bow and says, \u201cWith pleasure, madam,\u201d and it is written down in a book.</p><p>The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.</p><p>But there is no money in what is called the \u201ctill.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp21.png'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig22.jpg'></img><p>The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.</p><p>But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit\u2019s.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp24.png'></img><p>As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.</p><p>Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.</p><p>They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp26.png'></img><p>When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog licence.</p><p>\u201cIt is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,\u201d said Pickles.</p><p>\u201cIt is your own fault for being a terrier; I do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;\u201d said Pickles. \u201cThe place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe that he intends to pay at all,\u201d replied Ginger.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig29.jpg'></img><p>\u201cAnd I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things\u2014Where are all the cream crackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have eaten them yourself,\u201d replied Ginger.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp31.png'></img><p>Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.</p><p>They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend in all the bills again to everybody \u2018with compts,'\u201d replied Ginger.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig33.jpg'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp34.png'></img><p>After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!</p><p>Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.</p><p>\u201cBite him, Pickles! bite him!\u201d spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel, \u201che\u2019s only a German doll!\u201d</p><p>The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.</p><p>Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig37.jpg'></img><p>At length on his last little rush\u2014Pickles found that the shop was empty. The policeman had disappeared.</p><p>But the envelope remained.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp38.png'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp39.png'></img><p>\u201cDo you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid it is a summons,\u201d said Pickles.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, \u201cit is the rates and taxes, \u00a33 19 11-3/4.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the last straw,\u201d said Pickles, \u201clet us close the shop.\u201d</p><p>They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp41.png'></img><p>Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp43.png'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig44.jpg'></img><p>Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp46.png'></img><p>The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.</p><p>Of course there are the tradesmen\u2019s carts\u2014the butcher, the fish-man and Timothy Baker.</p><p>But a person cannot live on \u201cseed wigs\u201d and sponge-cake and butter-buns\u2014not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy\u2019s!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp49.png'></img><p>After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.</p><p>But they did not keep \u201cself-fitting sixes\u201d; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig51.jpg'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp52.png'></img><p>Besides\u2014the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp53.png'></img><p>And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.</p><p>And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but \u201cvery snug;\u201d which is not the way to carry on a retail business.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp55.png'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp56.png'></img><p>So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop\u2014Henny\u2019s Opening Sale! Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny\u2019s penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!\u201d</p><p>The poster really was most \u2018ticing.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/ginger_fig58.jpg'></img><p>There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.</p><p>Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/grayp60.png'></img><p>And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.</p><p>There is something to please everybody.</p>"}
