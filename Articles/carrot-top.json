Standing still made his arms ache. Blackbird nested in his straw and Harvey harvest mouse curled up in his trousers to sleep. The rabbits used nibble at the sugar beet.</p><p>One day the farmer came with his tractor to dig the beet and didn\u2019t need him any more so he propped him up at the side of the field. Carrot Top felt sad and unwanted.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to live?\u201d asked Blacky and Harvey.</p><p>Carrot Top did not know what to do.\u00a0His friends left him and started looking for a new home. It had started to rain, making his straw hat soggy and tweed jacket wet. Tears trickled down his turnip face. He felt all alone.</p><p>When the farmer went to lunch, the scarecrow hopped across into the next field which had cows in it. Carrot Top did not see them until they mooed making him jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in our field?\u201d asked the cows.</p><p>\u201cFarmer don\u2019t want me any more,\u201d replied Carrot Top.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t either,\u201d said Bella a big brown heifer.</p><p>Carrot Top went on his way and came to a sheep field. They all stared.</p><p>\u201cBaa, we don\u2019t want you!\u201d\u00a0they said.</p><p>In the next field was a horse and a young foal (which is a baby horse.)</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in our field?\u201d said the brown mare.</p><p>\u201cThe farmer does not want me,\u201d replied Carrot Top.</p><p>\u201cWell you can keep us company,\u201d neighed Blaze, a black horse with a white star on his nose. \u201cMake sure you shut the gate.\u201d</p><p>He made his way to the lane and shut the gate. The sun came out, drying his jacket. He had not gone far when a tractor and trailer came along. Carrot Top thought it was farmer Bates, but it was someone else.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to be late, hop in,\u201d he heard.</p><p>Carrot Top did as he was told, but did not know what he was going to be late for. In the trailer were several scarecrows \u2013 one was dressed as a policeman with his helmet, another lady one was little bow peep minus the sheep.Two older ones were the two ugly sisters</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Carrot Top, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cinders and these are my horrible sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey watch it!\u201d they said, kicking out at her.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone you bullies,\u201d replied Carrot Top.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the scarecrow festival silly,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI did not know about it,\u201d said Carrot Top. I was put out of my field as farmer Bates did not want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I am sorry, you can stay with us,\u201d replied Cinders.</p><p>Carrot top glowed inside; it was nice to be wanted. They reached the village and farmer helped Carrot Top and Cinders out. He placed them on the wall in front of the church. It was Sunday and he could hear the singing. When all the people came out they all had a look at the scarecrows. One little girl said he looked scruffy. Carrot Top felt a bit sad and a big tear rolled down his cheek. Anna her friend saw it and said \u201cYou\u2019re making him cry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarecrows don\u2019t cry, they are made of straw,\u201d the girl replied. He felt even more hurt.</p><p>\u201cShall we find him some more clothes?\u201d one asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dad has an old jacket he does not wear,\u201d said the other,\u00a0so the two girls ran off home and were soon back with a very smart leather jacket. They soon had him dressed after much tugging of straw Carrot Top felt snug.</p><p>\u201cHe will need a hat,\u201d they said.\u00a0 They soon brought a cap</p><p>Next day all the villagers walked past including the mayor they poked and prodded him. Carrot Top did not like it, he wished he was back in his field with his friends. All the other scarecrows were all round the village, which was decorated with flowers. One man in the crowd looked at Carrot Top.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best leather jacket,\u201d he cried. The man looked round for his daughter, but she had gone. The mayor said he could have it back after the judging.</p><p>\u201cWait till I see Becky,\u201d he said.</p><p>Carrot top did not want her to get into trouble, but be could not talk to humans. Later that day the judging began. The best female scarecrow was Cinders and the winner was Carrot Top. He was thrilled and was put on show and\u00a0had his photo in the local paper.\u00a0Farmer Bates wished he had put him in the festival himself. Becky\u2019s dad had his jacket back.\u00a0So if you see a scarecrow on a church wall, it will be Carrot Top.</p>"}
