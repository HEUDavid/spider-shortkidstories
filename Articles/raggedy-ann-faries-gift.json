She raised her head from the little pillow.</p><p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s you, Fido!\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cI dreamed the tin soldier put an icicle down my neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Fido told Raggedy Ann. \u201cI feel that something is about to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been eating too many bones lately, Fido, and they keep you awake,\u201d Raggedy replied.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t that. I haven\u2019t had any bones since the folks had beef last Sunday. It isn\u2019t that. Listen, Raggedy!\u201d</p><p>Raggedy Ann listened.</p><p>There was a murmur as if someone were singing, far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Fido.</p><p>\u201cSh!\u201d cautioned Raggedy Ann, \u201cIt\u2019s music.\u201d</p><p>It was indeed music, the most beautiful music Raggedy Ann had ever heard.</p><p>It grew louder, but still seemed to be far away.</p><p>Raggedy Ann and Fido could hear it distinctly and it sounded as if hundreds of voices were singing in unison.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t howl, Fido,\u201d Raggedy Ann said as she put her two rag arms around the dog\u2019s nose. Fido usually \u201csang\u201d when he heard music.</p><p>But Fido did not sing this time; he was filled with wonder. It seemed as if something very nice was going to happen.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s10c.jpg'></img><p>Raggedy Ann sat upright in bed. The room was flooded with a strange, beautiful light and the music came floating in through the nursery window.</p><p>Raggedy Ann hopped from her bed and ran across the floor, trailing the bed clothes behind her. Fido followed close behind and together they looked out the window across the flower garden.</p><p>There among the flowers were hundreds of tiny beings, some playing on tiny reed instruments and flower horns, while others sang. This was the strange, wonderful music Raggedy and Fido had heard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Fairies!\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cTo your basket quick, Fido! They are coming this way!\u201d And Raggedy Ann ran back to her bed, with the bed clothes trailing behind her.</p><p>Fido gave three jumps and he was in his basket, pretending he was sound asleep, but one little black eye was peeping through a chink in the side.</p><p>Raggedy jumped into her bed and pulled the covers to her chin, but lay so that her shoe-button eyes could see towards the window.</p><p>Little Fairy forms radiant as silver came flitting into the nursery, singing in far away voices. They carried a little bundle. A beautiful light came from this bundle, and to Raggedy Ann and Fido it seemed like sunshine and moonshine mixed. It was a soft mellow light, just the sort of light you would expect to accompany Fairy Folk.</p><p>As Raggedy watched, her candy heart went pitty-pat against her cotton stuffing, for she saw a tiny pink foot sticking out of the bundle of light.</p><p>The Fairy troop sailed across the nursery and through the door with their bundle and Raggedy Ann and Fido listened to their far away music as they went down the hall.</p><p>Presently the Fairies returned without the bundle and disappeared through the nursery window.</p><p>Raggedy Ann and Fido again ran to the window and saw the Fairy troop dancing among the flowers.</p><p>The light from the bundle still hung about the nursery and a strange lovely perfume floated about.</p><p>When the Fairies\u2019 music ceased and they had flown away, Raggedy Ann and Fido returned to Raggedy\u2019s bed to think it all out.</p><p>When old Mister Sun peeped over the garden wall and into the nursery, and the other dolls awakened, Raggedy Ann and Fido were still puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Raggedy Ann?\u201d asked the tin soldier and Uncle Clem, in one voice.</p><p>Before Raggedy Ann could answer, Marcella came running into the nursery, gathered up all the dolls in her arms, and ran down the hall, Fido jumping beside her and barking shrilly.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Marcella said to Fido, \u201cIt\u2019s asleep and you might awaken it!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s10d.jpg'></img><p>Mamma helped Marcella arrange all the dolls in a circle around the bed so that they could all see what was in the bundle.</p><p>Mamma gently pulled back the soft covering and the dolls saw a tiny little fist as pink as coral, a soft little face with a cunning tiny pink nose, and a little head as bald as the French dolly\u2019s when her hair came off.</p><p>My, how the dollies all chattered when they were once again left alone in the nursery!</p><p>\u201cA dear cuddly baby brother for Mistress!\u201d said Uncle Clem.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful bundle of love and Fairy Sunshine for everybody in the house!\u201d said Raggedy Ann, as she went to the toy piano and joyously played \u201cPeter-Peter-Pumpkin-Eater\u201d with one rag hand.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s10e.jpg'></img>"}
