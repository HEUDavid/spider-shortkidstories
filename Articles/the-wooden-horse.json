My! The paint was pretty and shiny.</p><p>The wooden horse was hitched to the wagon with a leather harness; and he, himself, stood proudly on a red base running on four little wheels.</p><p>It was true that the wooden horse\u2019s eyes were as far apart as a camel\u2019s and made him look quite like one when viewed from in front, but he had soft leather ears and a silky mane and tail.</p><p>He was nice to look at, was the wooden horse. All the dolls patted him and smoothed his silky mane and felt his shiny leather harness the first night they were alone with him in the nursery.</p><p>The wooden horse had a funny voice; the dolls could hardly understand him at first, but when his shyness wore off, he talked quite plainly.</p><p>\u201cIt is the first time I have ever tried to talk,\u201d he explained when he got to know them, \u201cand I guess I was talking down in my stomach instead of my head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will like it here in the nursery very much!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cWe have such fun times and love each other so much I know you will enjoy your new home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure I will!\u201d the wooden horse answered. \u201cWhere I came from, we\u2014the other horses and myself\u2014just stood silently on the shelves and looked and looked straight ahead, and never so much as moved our tails.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-076.jpg'></img><p>\u201cSee if you can move your tail now!\u201d Henny, the Dutch doll, suggested.</p><p>The wooden horse started to roll across the nursery floor and if Raggedy Ann had not been in the way, he might have bumped into the wall. As it was, the wooden horse rolled against Raggedy Ann and upset her but could go no further when his wheels ran against her rag foot.</p><p>When the wooden horse upset Raggedy Ann, he stood still until Uncle Clem and Henny and Raggedy Andy lifted him off Raggedy Ann\u2019s feet. \u201cDid I move my tail?\u201d he asked when Raggedy Ann stood up and smoothed her apron.</p><p>\u201cTry it again!\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see!\u201d She laughed her cheery rag doll laugh, for Raggedy Ann, no matter what happened, never lost her temper.</p><p>The wooden horse started rolling backward at this and knocked Henny over upon his back, causing him to cry \u201cMama!\u201d in his squeaky voice.</p><p>Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, and the tin soldier all held to the wooden horse and managed to stop him just as he was backing out of the nursery door towards the head of the stairs.</p><p>Then the dolls pulled the wooden horse back to the center of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s funny\u201d he said, \u201cthat I start moving backward or forward when I try to move my tail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it is because you have stood so long upon the shelf without moving,\u201d Raggedy Andy suggested. \u201cSuppose you try moving forward!\u201d</p><p>Uncle Clem, who was standing in front of the wooden horse, jumped to one side so hastily his feet slipped out from under him, just as if he had been sliding upon slippery ice.</p><p>\u00a0</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-077.jpg'></img><p>The wooden horse did not start moving forward as Uncle Clem had expected; instead, his silky tail moved\u00a0up over his back.</p><p>\u201cWhee! There, you moved your tail!\u201d cried all the dolls as joyfully as if the wooden horse had done something truly wonderful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy now!\u201d said the wooden horse. \u201cWhen I wish to go forward or backward I\u2019ll try to move my tail and then I\u2019ll roll along on my shiny wheels; then when I wish to move my tail I\u2019ll try to roll forward or backward, like this!\u201d But instead of rolling forward, the wooden horse moved his tail. \u201cI wanted to move my tail then!\u201d he said in surprise. \u201cNow I\u2019ll roll forward!\u201d And sure enough, the wooden horse rolled across the nursery floor.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-078.jpg'></img><p>When he started rolling upon his shiny wheels, Raggedy Andy cried, \u201cAll aboard!\u201d and, taking a short run, he leaped upon the wooden horse\u2019s back. Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, Henny, the Dutch doll and Susan, the doll without a head, all scrambled up into the pretty red wagon.</p><p>The wooden horse thought this was great fun and round\u00a0and round the nursery he circled. His shiny wheels and the pretty yellow wheels of the red wagon creaked so loudly none of the dolls heard the cries of the tiny penny dolls who were too small to climb aboard. Finally, as the wagon load of dolls passed the penny dolls, Raggedy Andy noticed the two little midgets standing together and missing the fun; so, leaning \u2018way over to one side as the horse swept by them, Raggedy Andy caught both the penny dolls in his strong rag arms and lifted them to a seat upon the broad back of the wooden horse.</p><p>\u201cHooray!\u201d cried all the dolls when they saw Raggedy Andy\u2019s feat. \u201cIt was just like a Wild West Show!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must all have all the fun we can together!\u201d said Raggedy Andy.</p><p>\u201cGood for you!\u201d cried Uncle Clem. \u201cThe more fun we can give each other, the more fun each one of us will have!\u201d</p><p>The wooden horse made the circle of the nursery a great many times, for it pleased him very much to hear the happy laughter of the dolls and he thought to himself, \u201cHow happy I will be, living with such a fun crowd.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-079.jpg'></img><p>But just as he was about to pass the door, there was a noise upon the stairs and the wooden horse, hearing it, stopped so suddenly Raggedy Andy and the penny dolls went clear over his head and the dolls in the front of the wagon took Raggedy Andy\u2019s seat upon the horse\u2019s back.</p><p>They lay just as they fell, for they did not wish anyone to suspect that they could move or talk.</p><p>\u201cHa! Ha! Ha! I knew you were having a lot of fun!\u201d cried a cheery voice.</p><p>At this, all the dolls immediately scrambled back into their former places, for they recognized the voice of the French doll.</p><p>But what was their surprise to see her dressed in a lovely fairy costume, her lovely curls flying out behind, as she ran towards them.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-080.jpg'></img><p>Raggedy Andy was just about to climb upon the horse\u2019s\u00a0back again when the French doll leaped there herself and, balancing lightly upon one foot, stood in this position while the wooden horse rolled around the nursery as fast as he could go.</p><p>Raggedy Andy and the two penny dolls ran after the wagon and, with the assistance of Uncle Clem and Raggedy Ann, climbed up in back.</p><p>When the wooden horse finally stopped the dolls all said, \u201cThis is the most fun we have had for a long time!\u201d</p><p>The wooden horse, a thrill of happiness running through his wooden body, cried, \u201cIt is the most fun I have ever had!\u201d</p><p>And the dolls, while they did not tell him so, knew that he had had the most fun because he had given them the most pleasure.</p><p>For, as you must surely know, they who are the most unselfish are the ones who gain the greatest joy; because they give happiness to others.</p>"}
