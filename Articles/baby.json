The thick door had been locked and barred to discourage new customers. Leah\u2019s father, the innkeeper, was tired of explaining that the inn was overcrowded \u2014 that there just wasn\u2019t any room anywhere.</p><p>Even the tiny room where Leah and her sister slept had been taken for guests. They would be sleeping downstairs by the fire this night. But travelers still kept coming, pounding on the door, begging for lodging.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, girl!\u00a0 Lazy \u2014 that\u2019s what ya are!\u201d</p><p>Leah struggled with the heavy wooden bar and finally succeeded in swinging the door inward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s no room\u2026.\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said the man urgently. \u201cWe need a place quickly. Anything. My wife needs to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery room is taken, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I see the innkeeper?\u00a0 It\u2019s very important.\u201d</p><p>Leah hesitated, knowing that her father would be angry if she let the man in. Then Leah saw the woman on the donkey. Even in the dim light, Leah could see the weariness in her face. In the seconds that Leah was preoccupied with watching her, the husband slipped by her into the building.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you there is no room here!\u201d roared Leah\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cPlease. It\u2019s nearly dark and we have come a very long way\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have come a long way!\u201d shouted one man.</p><p>\u201cBut my wife is with child,\u201d the stranger pleaded.</p><p>Many of the customers turned to listen. Leah\u2019s mother was making her way\u00a0between the tables with a tray of food. She thrust the tray into Leah\u2019s hands, then placed her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWith child!\u00a0 We don\u2019t want the woman here!\u00a0 We\u2019ve got all we can handle now!\u201d</p><p>Leah listened to the conversation as she served the food. She wished that someone would be willing to double up for the sake of the pregnant lady but nobody offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the little shelter that I saw in back?\u00a0 Is it the stable?\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t we stay there?\u00a0 I will pay, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Leah\u2019s mother exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll not have the woman here. What if she has her baby?\u201d</p><p>But Leah recognized the greedy look that came into her father\u2019s eyes. She had seen it many times before.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d the innkeeper said thoughtfully, \u201cI suppose I could let you stay out there if you\u2019re willing to pay. But we can\u2019t wait on you. We\u2019re too busy as it is.\u201d</p><p>The stranger\u2019s face showed his great relief as he turned to go. \u201cThank you. We won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Leah\u2019s father shouted. \u201cI want my money now!\u00a0 I don\u2019t want ya sneakin\u2019 off in the night without paying.\u201d</p><p>The stranger wearily opened his pouch and handed over the coins, then went out.</p><p>\u201cGet back to work!\u201d Leah felt her mother\u2019s large hand gripping her shoulder and she was shoved into the kitchen area. Leah, knowing that her mother was furious with the arrangement, ducked out of her reach. It wasn\u2019t unusual for the woman to take her frustrations out on the girls.</p><p>\u201cIf she has that baby, they\u2019ll get no help from us. We have enough to do. And they needn\u2019t think they will get service out there either,\u201d the woman muttered as she picked up a tray of bread and disappeared into the main room.</p><p>Leah pounced on her older sister with the news. \u201cNaomi!\u00a0 There\u2019s a woman with child outside! In the stable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I heard.\u201d\u00a0 Naomi was a slender, pretty, fifteen year old. She stooped before the fire, stirring the stew that was cooking in a large pot. \u201cThey certainly paid enough to be able to have a little food. I\u2019ll give you some to take out later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman looked very tired. I\u2019ll get some blankets for them. It\u2019s cold tonight.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Hours of work loomed ahead. There was plenty to be done with so many customers in the inn. There was meat to be roasted, bread to be set, meals to be served, dishes to be washed. But Naomi\u2019s fingers flew to make up for Leah\u2019s absence.</p><p>The younger girl made her way to the stable, arms piled with blankets which she had taken from other customers\u2019 beds, one from this room, another from that. They had plenty. They wouldn\u2019t miss them. Or if they did, she didn\u2019t care. The inn was drafty but certainly much warmer than the stable. She even brought cushions from her own pallet. The cushions were old and shabby but she was sure that the couple wouldn\u2019t mind.</p><p>Leah found the man trying to make his wife comfortable. He had arranged a pile of hay and covered it with a blanket that they had brought from home. The woman was shivering as she lay wrapped in another blanket. Apparently, they had only brought two, not expecting to have to sleep in a cold barn.</p><p>Leah struggled to close the door against the wind and the man came quickly to help her.</p><p>\u201cHere are blankets,\u201d Leah said, moving to the corner where the woman lay.</p><p>The woman was very pretty and not much older than Naomi.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered as Leah lifted her up and placed a cushion under her head.</p><p>The man covered her with the blankets and tucked them in securely.</p><p>\u201cYou should keep one for yourself, Joseph,\u201d the woman said, weakly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d her husband told her. Then he turned to Leah. \u201cTell your father we are grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, sir. Nor my mother. I\u2019ll bring you some food later.\u201d</p><p>The man understood immediately. \u201cThen we are grateful to you. But any food you bring, I will pay for.\u201d</p><p>A slight groan brought their attention back to the woman. Leah saw that her face was distorted with pain.</p><p>\u201cJoseph,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s eyes widened in horror. \u201cNow\u2026here?\u201d</p><p>Leah stood frozen to the spot. The woman was going to have her baby in their stable!\u00a0 Joseph dropped to his knees beside his wife.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Another spasm of pain caused her to squeeze his hands tightly. \u201cYou should get some help, Joseph,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d He sprang to his feet and addressed Leah. \u201cIs there a midwife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My mother can tell you where to find her.\u201d</p><p>Leah dashed back to the inn and burst through the side door. Her mother and sister were busy making meat pastries.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d her mother snapped.</p><p>\u201cMother! The lady is having her baby!\u201d</p><p>Leah\u2019s mother placed her hands on her hips, her usual stance when she was angry. \u201cThere! Didn\u2019t I say this would happen?\u00a0 They can fend for themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but Mother!\u00a0 Please\u2026.\u201d pleaded Naomi.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I run for the midwife?\u201d asked Leah.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re needed here. Don\u2019t you see that crowd out there?\u00a0 Besides, she\u2019s ill and of course we have no doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be someone somewhere!\u201d cried Leah, hysterically.</p><p>Naomi calmed her little sister with a look. \u201cPlease, Mother,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe woman is away from home in a strange town. It isn\u2019t her fault that Caesar decreed the registration now. And they did pay very well.\u201d</p><p>But Naomi was wasting her time. Their mother set her lips stubbornly and continued twisting the dough and plumping it up firmly. Help, however, came from another source.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the noise in here!\u00a0 And where is the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Leah said, quickly. \u201cThe woman is having her baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that to me?\u00a0 Go out there and serve the customers!\u00a0 They\u2019re waiting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d put in Naomi, \u201cThey are customers and they\u2019ve paid well. What will \u00a0our reputation be if the baby dies?\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room as the greedy man mulled that thought over. Leah wondered what their \u00a0reputation would be if people knew they had put a woman with child in the stable but she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cBabies die all the time!\u201d Leah\u2019s mother finally broke the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s not our concern.\u201d</p><p>But the innkeeper had made his decision. \u201cGo help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d\u00a0 He walked out of the room, back to his wine and customers.</p><p>Naomi received a stinging blow across the face for her efforts toward the little family in the stable. Leah knew it hurt but as their mother headed out in a huff, Naomi\u00a0 sprang into action to collect what was needed for the birthing.</p><p>\u201cGo quickly with water,\u201d said Naomi. \u201cI\u2019ll heat some more.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Leah looked up at the stars for just a second. How beautiful they were tonight. And there was one that was so very bright.</p><p>She didn\u2019t linger long, for as beautiful as it was, the night was very chilly and\u00a0the wind whipped her robes. And the lady needed her help. She hurried on to the stable with the bucket of water and several towels. She handed over the supplies and paused a moment at the sight of the pregnant woman\u2019s pale, twisted face.</p><p>Joseph paced just inside the door, stopping now and then to absentmindedly pat the handsome horse of a wealthy customer or feed his donkey a handful of hay. Then he would wring his hands and pace some more.</p><p>Leah hesitated, knowing that a little girl shouldn\u2019t address a grown man. Most men didn\u2019t even acknowledge women in public but she thought that such a kind man wouldn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cSir, what is your wife\u2019s name?\u201d\u00a0 She had been wondering ever since the couple had arrived.</p><p>He stopped pacing and smiled at her. \u201cHer name is Mary,\u201d he answered, as if the very thought of his beloved wife brought joy.</p><p>\u201cShe will be well,\u201d Leah assured him.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Hours later, Leah and Naomi crept out to the stable. Their mother had gone to her\u00a0room, blustering that it was finally over and that she was ready for a good night\u2019s sleep. She had told them that no one was to disturb her for anything.</p><p>Naomi held a bowl of soup carefully and Leah carried bread and meat for Joseph. The man had refused to eat, refused to leave the stable throughout the long birth. The innkeeper was disgusted for he had hoped that the man would come in and buy much wine in celebration of his newborn son.</p><p>\u201cMay we see him?\u201d asked Leah as they entered.</p><p>Joseph nodded happily and motioned toward the corner.</p><p>In the shadows they saw Mary lying in her hollow of hay and blankets. Her face was white and pinched but she smiled weakly. Nestled in her arms was the tiny baby, wrapped tightly in swaddling cloths so that only his little red face could be seen. He was sound asleep. Leah knelt down and touched his cheek very lightly.</p><p>\u201cLet Naomi hold the baby,\u201d said Joseph to his wife. \u201cYou must eat this while it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Naomi took the baby so gently that he hardly stirred.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d she crooned as she cradled the infant. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a newborn before.\u201d</p><p>Joseph lifted Mary up while Leah held the bowl of soup for her. The woman was so weary that she couldn\u2019t even finish.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring you some more later,\u201d said Leah as Joseph gently eased his wife down again.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do with the child?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>They thought for a moment. Then Mary murmured with a weak wave of her hand, \u201cThe manger. He will be safe there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good idea.\u201d\u00a0 Joseph carried the wooden trough over.</p><p>Leah helped him clean it out and went to fetch fresh straw. They arranged a blanket so that the prickly straw would not even touch the baby. Then Naomi laid the infant in the trough. They all watched as his mouth pursed as if to cry, then closed again. His eyes never even opened.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so wonderful,\u201d murmured Naomi. Then she shook her head angrily and turned to Joseph. \u201cWhat a place for a baby!\u00a0 How I wish it could have been different. We would gladly have given our room if it hadn\u2019t already been taken. It\u2019s very small but at least it\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>Joseph stopped her outburst. \u201cWe\u2019re not angry with your father. We are grateful even for this stable. Mary was sure that Jehovah would provide a place.\u201d\u00a0 He lifted his hand toward the bruise on her cheek. \u201cYour sister tells us you convinced them that we needed help.\u201d</p><p>Naomi turned back to the manger, embarrassed now. Then she smiled as she watched the baby sleep. \u201cHe looks like a little prince, doesn\u2019t he?\u00a0 Even in this dirty, smelly place.\u201d</p><p>Joseph and Mary glanced at each other, as if startled by the remark. Leah wondered about it. It was as if they knew a secret. But the idea of pretending that the baby was a little prince appealed to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our prince,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cOur very own little prince!\u00a0 Please may we think of him as ours since he was born in our stable?\u201d</p><p>Mary smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name going to be?\u201d asked Naomi. \u201cJoseph, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Jesus,\u201d said the father.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful name for our little prince,\u201d said Naomi. \u201cWhy it even means \u2018Savior.\u2019 \u201d\u00a0 A sudden thought came to her and she added wistfully, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if he really were a prince\u2026our Messiah\u2026come to save us from our captors?\u00a0 But how foolish\u2026the Messiah born in a stable. Though the Scriptures do say he is to be born in Bethlehem\u2026.\u201d</p><p>Joseph listened to her musings, then said. \u201cThat is true.\u201d He took a deep breath, \u201cNaomi, he is the Savior\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened just then as a guest came in to care for his animal and Joseph fell silent.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d said Naomi. \u201cYou need to sleep, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am weary,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long day but I am thankful for Jehovah\u2019s great care for Mary and I and the little one. And God has used you to help us. We are grateful.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at Mary and they found that she was sound asleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>The girls tiptoed out. All the way across the courtyard, Leah felt such happiness in her heart at the thought of the little baby inside but suddenly, she heard a loud commotion. It seemed to be coming from out on the street, right in front of the inn. Sure enough, she heard loud pounding on the front door.</p><p>\u201cDrunken men!\u201d said Naomi in disgust, \u201cAll that noise! Mary and the baby will be sure to wake up!\u201d</p><p>She headed for the front of the inn, determined.</p><p>Leah, realizing what her sister was planning, ran after her. \u201cNaomi! Wait!\u201d</p><p>She knew that if the drunken men became angry, Naomi might be hurt.</p><p>But when they reached the entrance to the inn, she realized that the voices were not raised in drunkenness but in excitement. The men were familiar to them, common working men, shepherds who should have been out in the hills, not in town at this time of night.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d Leah wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s taking care of the sheep?\u201d added Naomi.</p><p>They listened as their father angrily opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it! Can\u2019t you see the sign on the door?\u00a0 We have no room! Why, Jacob! \u00a0And Aram!\u00a0 What are you doing here?\u00a0 And why all the noise?\u00a0 I have customers sleeping!\u201d</p><p>One shepherd reached out and grasped his arm. \u201cAnswer us this! In your stable!\u00a0 Is there anyone in your stable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a baby there?\u201d burst out a boy about Naomi\u2019s age.</p><p>Someone shushed the boy. \u201cTell us quickly. We\u2019ve been all over town and no one knows of what we speak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you speaking of?\u00a0 Yes, there\u2019s a baby out there. Travelers came at sunset and they agreed to stay in the stable. There\u2019s no room anywhere else. You know how it is.\u201d\u00a0 The innkeeper shrugged his shoulders, as if suddenly fearful of his reputation.</p><p>Leah wondered how these men had ever found out. Did they know the baby was a newborn and that her father had allowed it all to happen out in the stable?</p><p>\u201cWhat is this about?\u00a0 I demand to know!\u201d</p><p>But the shepherds were already heading for the stable, oblivious to the innkeeper\u2019s shouts. They were talking among themselves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as they said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby in a stable!\u00a0 Who would have thought it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he in the manger, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said?\u201d shouted Leah\u2019s father. \u201cHow could you know this?\u201d</p><p>One shepherd called back over his shoulder, \u201cAngels told us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels! They have gone mad!\u201d said the innkeeper to several of his customers who had come out to see what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWhat about angels?\u201d asked one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d shouted the innkeeper. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to find out!\u201d\u00a0 He rushed after the shepherds with his customers trailing along behind.</p><p>Leah stopped her friend Eliud, one of the younger shepherds.</p><p>\u201cEliud.\u201d She grasped his arm, \u201cWhat is it! What happened?\u201d</p><p>Eliud was just a year or two older than Leah. His dark eyes were wide with excitement. \u201cAngels, Leah! They filled the sky! We were terrified but they told us not to be afraid. They told us they had good news. That a savior had been born!\u201d</p><p>Leah interrupted excitedly, \u201cA savior!\u00a0 Why, that\u2019s what his name means!\u00a0 They\u2019re calling him Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said we\u2019d find him laying in a manger! That\u2019s why we were looking in the stables! Come on! I want to see him!\u201d</p><p>She hurried after him to see what was going on at the stable. When Leah reached the little building, everyone had already crowded in. They were all very quiet. They hadn\u2019t awakened the baby. The men were just watching him sleep, looks of wonder and reverence on their faces. Mary was awake, however, and was sitting up, her robes drawn around her. After a few minutes, the shepherds told Joseph, in low tones, what had happened and Mary listened closely.</p><p>The shepherds stayed a long while. Eliud talked to Leah, telling in glowing terms about the multitude of angels who had been praising Jehovah and speaking of peace.</p><p>\u201cPeace, Leah!\u201d he told her excitedly. \u201cThe Messiah who will bring us peace. No more Romans! Israel will have freedom at last!\u201d</p><p>Leah\u2019s father and a few of the more drunken customers left before the shepherds did.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ya want something to warm ya up, eh?\u201d he had asked hopefully. \u201cAngels! \u00a0Sounds like you need a little wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No! We want to spread the good news. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! It\u2019s foolish! He\u2019s just an ordinary little baby. And look at the parents. Poor and shabby as any of us. Angels! Bah!\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper stalked out, angry that the shepherds weren\u2019t going to give him any business, but some of the customers stayed and listened to the talk.</p><p>Finally, all was quiet. Leah watched as Eliud and the other shepherds left the courtyard, heading through town to tell the good news to everyone they met.</p><p>A few people whom they told did come to see the baby, but not many, for after all it was midnight.</p><p>When they were alone again, Naomi brought more food.</p><p>\u201cHave some more soup, Mary,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>She was stronger now, able to hold the bowl herself and also to eat a chunk of bread. Then, at last, the infant woke and the girls heard his lusty cry for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard him cry before,\u201d said Naomi.</p><p>\u201cWe heard him, didn\u2019t we, Mary?\u00a0 He has a good, strong voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may get tired of his good, strong voice,\u201d Mary laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s hungry. Naomi, bring him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please! May I?\u201d\u00a0 Leah begged. \u201cI know how to carry a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, bring him,\u201d Mary consented.</p><p>Leah approached the manger. She picked up the squalling baby. For just a moment, as Leah cradled him, he quieted, content with being held. Then he cried out again and Leah carefully placed him in the arms of his mother.</p><p>I have held the Messiah, she thought.</p><p>In that moment, she believed with all her heart what Eliud had said. Angelic messengers had proclaimed it. She didn\u2019t understand why he was here in this stable as a tiny baby and not a grown man come from heaven to drive out Caesar from his palace. But she knew she didn\u2019t need to understand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Messiah, isn\u2019t he,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe Messiah!\u201d exclaimed Naomi. She had missed much of the discussion in the stable.</p><p>\u201cEliud said so,\u201d Leah replied.\u201cHe told me that the angels called him \u2018the Christ.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Naomi turned to the couple, her eyes wide with wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. There was so much confusion and then my mother called me. I believe that angels came to them. They are honest men and wouldn\u2019t lie but\u2026is he really the Messiah?\u201d</p><p>Joseph nodded slowly. \u201cMany strange things have happened. Mary was visited by an angel and I was spoken to in a dream. Yes, he is the Messiah. There are things we don\u2019t understand either. We only know that Jehovah has given us his Son to take care of.\u201d</p><p>They all watched the wondrous infant as he lay, asleep again, in his mother\u2019s arms, and wondered what it all meant.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Later as the sisters lay beside the fire, Naomi said, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think who might be able to help Joseph and Mary. They can\u2019t travel with a newborn baby, but they can\u2019t stay in the stable either.\u201d</p><p>Leah was almost asleep as she murmured, \u201cWhat about Aunt Salome?\u201d</p><p>Naomi sat up excitedly. \u201cOf course! Why didn\u2019t we think of her before. She could have taken them in and helped with the birthing. If only we had thought. Leah, you must go first thing and tell Aunt Salome about them.
