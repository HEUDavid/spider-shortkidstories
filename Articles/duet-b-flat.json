And after a hard day of work, he spent his nights drinking beer and partying with his buddies into the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Raising a child, he always said, was never part of my life plan.</p><p>So, at age thirteen, Tiffany was on her own.\u00a0 She ate food that was mostly fried, salty, and found in a bag left on the counter.\u00a0 She wore clothing that was usually one size too small, one shade too bright, and one season too late.\u00a0 She did her homework on a table sticky with the residue of beer, and then she spent her evenings watching reality shows on TV.</p><p>No one paid attention to Tiffany, which was fine with her.\u00a0 Actually, she preferred it that way.\u00a0 Until the day that her dad forgot to do the laundry.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>On that same November morning, Charlene Wilcox was the first to board the school bus, as she was every morning.\u00a0 Her home, located in a trailer part on the edge of town, sat right next to the bus garage, so it was the first stop on the morning run.\u00a0 Charlene had to get up when the sun rose to feed her three little brothers and get them dressed, while her mother tended to the baby.\u00a0 Only then did she have time to get ready herself \u2013 to eat, shower, and style her long, thick, copper-colored hair.\u00a0 Charlene\u2019s hair cascaded gloriously down to the middle of her back, taking the better part of an hour to blow-dry and straighten every morning.</p><p>With four young children to take care of, Charlene\u2019s mom was too busy to pay attention to her at home.\u00a0 But at school, Charlene Wilcox ruled \u2013 the girls envied her hair and her attitude, and the boys competed with each other for her attention.\u00a0 Sashaying through the halls, she was followed by an admiring entourage.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>When Tiffany boarded the school bus that morning wearing her slightly funky sweater, she walked by Charlene and her friends. As Tiffany sidled by her, Charlene sniffed loudly and raised her thumb and index finger dramatically in the air.\u00a0 Then, looking directly at Tiffany, Charlene pinched her nose and announced to everyone on the bus, Something stinks.</p><p>Tiffany put her head down and kept walking, hoping no one had noticed.\u00a0 She tried to avoid the eyes following her through the bus. But as she made her way down the aisle, she couldn\u2019t avoid row after row of snickering kids who scrunched up their faces, pinched their noses, and repeated Charlene\u2019s words: Something stinks. So Tiffany chose a seat in the last row in the corner, hunched her shoulders, and slid down low.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Starting that morning, and continuing for almost two months, the phrase something stinks stuck to Tiffany like superglue.\u00a0 It started on the bus in the morning, and it followed her around school like a vicious dog snapping at her ankles.\u00a0 She heard it from the kids in the hall as she walked between classes. She heard it at lunch in the food line, and then again when she sat down at a table.\u00a0 In her classes, she saw the kids silently mouthing the words, sticking out their tongues and pretending to gag.\u00a0 And all the way home she heard it on the bus.</p><p>Each evening, Tiffany washed her clothes in the sink with detergent that promised the scent of wildflowers.\u00a0 Each morning she showered with citrus soap and lathered her hair with vanilla-almond shampoo that smelled good enough to eat.\u00a0 And she sprayed herself lightly with her father\u2019s cologne from the medicine cabinet before she walked out the door.\u00a0 Tiffany carried deodorant in her purse and applied it under her arms in the bathroom between classes.\u00a0 But none of these efforts could stop the gestures or the whispers or the constant humiliation that was now her life at school.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Then, one bright winter morning, Tiffany awoke with a feeling of happiness and anticipation.\u00a0 It was the last day of school before winter break.\u00a0 She sat up in bed and smiled as she calculated the time until school was out; three shortened class periods, a holiday concert, and then no more school for two weeks.</p><p>Foraging in the kitchen for something to eat, she discovered a Taco Bell Bean and Cheese Burrito which someone had left out on the counter the night before.\u00a0 Stuffing it into her mouth, she washed it down with the remains of a cold caramel cappuccino.\u00a0 Now she was feeling slightly queasy, but she grabbed her backpack anyway, and ran out the door to catch the bus.</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s class fidgeted through first period English, barely able to concentrate on the winter poem or the vocabulary review.\u00a0 As they filed out of the room, the English teacher, wishing them a happy holiday, handed each of them a milk chocolate Santa, wrapped in foil and slightly melted.\u00a0 In Math they played an algebra game and got candy canes and green marshmallow Christmas trees for prizes.\u00a0 In Spanish class, the Senora taught a lesson about Christmas in Mexico and handed out Mexican wedding cookies \u2013 rich balls of almond and butter, flavored with ginger and cinnamon, and rolled in powdered sugar.</p><p>Tiffany had been feeling slightly nauseous all morning long, but she dutifully put the treats she was offered in her mouth, chewed quickly, and gulped them down.\u00a0 The candy and the rich spicy cookie made their way down her digestive system to join the already churning burrito and cappuccino in her stomach, and by the end of the morning Tiffany was wondering if she would make it to the end of the day.</p><p>After classes were over, the kids filed into the auditorium for the concert, their voices ringing at a fevered pitch.\u00a0 And Tiffany\u2019s stomach started gurgling and growling. She thought about raising her hand and asking for a pass to leave the room.\u00a0 But she reconsidered when she thought about walking past the rows of kids who would surely be pinching their noses as she walked by. So she sat miserably, clutching her stomach.</p><p>The middle school students sat impatiently in their seats, squirming and looking back at the clock, counting the minutes to when the final bell would release them. They suffered through the principal\u2019s speech and then through the endless holiday songs performed woodenly by the mixed chorus.\u00a0 By this time, the pent-up energy in the overheated auditorium was palpable.\u00a0 And the pent-up energy of the Mexican wedding cookie, the Christmas candy and her breakfast was roiling and brewing in Tiffany\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Last on the program was a performance from the school orchestra, featuring Charlene Wilcox on the French horn.\u00a0 When her turn came, Charlene stood up, and tucking a stray strand of copper-colored hair behind her ear, she strode confidently through the woodwinds, past the violins, to the front of the stage.\u00a0 Facing the impatient and distracted student body, she waited imperially for the audience to settle down.\u00a0 When the audience was finally silent, she put the horn to her lips, and began to play her first note.</p><p>It was at that exact moment that Tiffany\u2019s stomach rebelled \u2013 loudly and odiferously \u2013 the sound ringing through the sudden silence of the auditorium, making itself known to the entire school in the key of B flat, like a foghorn signaling a ship in distress.\u00a0 There was complete silence in the auditorium as all eyes turned first to Tiffany, and then to Charlene, who was still standing in front of the stage, now holding her breath, her horn poised.</p><p>Tiffany was mortified.\u00a0 She wanted to hide under the seat.\u00a0 She felt like she was going to cry.\u00a0 But instead of crying, she started to giggle nervously. Then she began laughing uncontrollably \u2013 big big, loud guffaws \u2013 which set off yet more blasts of flatulence.</p><p>The other students were first startled, then delighted. They burst into wild laughter, while Charlene stood frozen in place, horn at her mouth, too shocked to move.</p><p>By then the teachers had lost control of their classes, and when the bell rang, the kids ran for the door and exited the building, still laughing as they poured into the snowy schoolyard to freedom.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The story of Charlene Wilcox\u2019s French horn solo became a school legend.\u00a0 The kids never got tired of retelling the story of how Charlene\u2019s solo unwittingly became a duet.\u00a0 For years after that, when Charlene walked to her seat on the bus, when she went through the halls of the school, when she sat in class, or took her seat in the cafeteria, the kids would bring an imaginary horn up to their lips and blow, making an all too identifiable sound.\u00a0 Then they pinched their noses, looked at each other and snickered.</p><p>And, although she knew she shouldn\u2019t, the one who laughed the loudest was Tiffany.</p>"}
