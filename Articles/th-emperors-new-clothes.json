His only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for his soldiers, and going to the theatre did not interest him. The only thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to go out and show himself off with new clothes as often as possible. He had a coat for every hour of the day. As often as you would say of a normal king \u201cHe is busy ruling the kingdom,\u201d you could say of him, \u201cThe emperor is in his dressing-room trying on new gear.\u201d</p><p>The great city where he lived was a very busy place, every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day, two swindlers came to this city and pretended to everyone that they were weavers. They said that they could make the finest cloth anyone could imagine. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only very beautiful, but were made of a special material invisible to any person who was stupid.</p><p>That must be wonderful cloth, thought the emperor. If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I would be able to find out which people in my kingdom are stupid and therefore should not be in their jobs. I must have this cloth made for me without delay.</p><p>And he gave a large sum of money to those rascals, in advance, so that they should get to work immediately. They set up two looms and pretended to be very hard at work. They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth. All the expensive material they got they hid away for themselves and worked at the empty looms till late at night.</p><p>I\u2019d love to know how they are getting on with the cloth, thought the emperor. But he felt worried when he remembered that anyone who couldn\u2019t see it was stupid. He thought that of course he would be able to see it, but decided to send someone else first to check it out, just in case. Everybody in the town knew how remarkable the clothes were and were dying to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were.</p><p>I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers, thought the emperor. He can see how it looks, for he is very clever.</p><p>The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat before the empty looms.\u00a0Goodness gracious! he thought and opened his eyes wide, I cannot see anything at all, but he did not say so. Both swindlers told him to come near and asked him if he did not admire the lovely pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen. Oh dear, he thought, Can I be so stupid? I would never have thought so, and nobody must find out! Is it possible that I am too stupid to do my job? No, I cannot admit that I wasn\u2019t able to see the cloth.</p><p>\u201cHave you got nothing to say?\u201d said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busy weaving.</p><p>\u201cOh, it is very pretty, really beautiful,\u201d replied the old minister looking through his glasses. \u201cWhat a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours! I will tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are pleased to hear that,\u201d said the two weavers and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The old minister listened carefully, so he would be able to tell the emperor what they said and so he did.</p><p>Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, which they said they required for weaving. They kept everything for themselves and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as before, to pretend to work at the empty looms.</p><p>Soon afterwards the emperor sent another good man to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.</p><p>\u201cIs it not a beautiful piece of cloth?\u201d asked the two rascals, showing and explaining the fantastic pattern, which, however, did not exist.</p><p>I think I am not stupid, thought the man. Maybe I am not clever enough for my job. I must not let any one know that and he praised the cloth, which he did not see and praised the beautiful colours and the fine pattern. \u201cIt is very excellent,\u201d he said to the emperor.</p><p>o \u2014 o \u2014 o</p><p>Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom. With a number of assistants, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread.</p><p>\u201cIs it not magnificent?\u201d said the two old men who had been there before. \u201cYour Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern.\u201d And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they expected that the others could see the cloth.</p><p>What is this? thought the emperor, I do not see anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Too stupid to be an emperor? That would indeed be the most terrible thing that could happen to me.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, turning to the weavers, \u201cyour cloth is wonderful, really wonderful.\u201d\u00a0 He nodded contentedly as he looked at the empty loom, because he didn\u2019t want to say that he couldn\u2019t see anything. All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, \u201cIt is very beautiful.\u201d And all advised him to wear the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take place. \u201cIt is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,\u201d they said. Everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers \u201cImperial Court weavers.\u201d</p><p>The whole night before the day on which the procession was to take place, these two rascals pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles. They wanted people to see that they were busy finishing the emperor\u2019s new clothes. They pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread. At last they said: \u201cThe emperor\u2019s new clothes are ready now.\u201d</p><p>The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall. The swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: \u201cThese are the trousers!\u201d \u201cThis is the coat!\u201d and \u201cHere is the cloak!\u201d and so on. \u201cThey are all as light as a cobweb, so light in fact, that it feels as if you have nothing on at all, but that is just the beauty of the clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d said all the assistants, but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen.</p><p>\u201cDoes it please your Majesty now to undress,\u201d said the swindlers, \u201cthat we may help your Majesty in putting on the new suit in front of the mirror?\u201d</p><p>The emperor undressed and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit on him, one piece after another. The emperor looked at himself in the glass from all sides.</p><p>\u201cHow well they look! How well they fit!\u201d said all. \u201cWhat a beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of clothes!\u201d</p><p>It was announced that it was time to start the procession.</p><p>\u201cI am ready,\u201d said the emperor. \u201cDoes not my suit fit me wonderfully?\u201d Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, so that people would think he was admiring his clothes again.</p><p>Two boys were there to walk behind the emperor, to hold up the train of the emperor\u2019s clothes, that is the material from his clothes that would otherwise trail behind on the ground. They stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up the train and pretended to hold something in their hands. They did not like people to know that they could not see or feel anything.</p><p>The emperor marched in the procession under a beautiful canopy and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: \u201cIndeed, the emperor\u2019s new suit is amazing! What a long train he has! How well it fits him!\u201d Nobody wanted to admit they saw nothing, for then it would mean they were too stupid. Never were the emperor\u2019s clothes more admired.</p><p>At last a little boy piped up. \u201cBut he has nothing on at all! He\u2019s completely nude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens! I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d said the embarrassed father. \u201cHe\u2019s just a simple boy who doesn\u2019t know any better.\u201d But soon, the whole crowd was whispering what the child had said.</p><p>\u201cHe does have nothing on at all!\u201d cried all the people, realising the truth. The emperor suddenly realised they were right, but he thought to himself, Now I must keep pretending until the end or I\u2019ll look even more stupid.</p><p>So the emperor tried to walk with even greater dignity, while the crowd laughed and teased him all the way to the end. Afterwards he sent his soldiers to arrest the two swindlers, but they had fled the city with all the money and precious material.</p><p>For the rest of his days, people joked about the time the emperor went for a parade with no clothes on and he never lived it down.</p>"}
