Scratch!\u2019 as plain as I hear you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did the sound come from, Fido?\u201d Raggedy Andy asked when he saw that Fido really was wide awake.</p><p>\u201cFrom outside somewhere!\u201d Fido answered. \u201cAnd if I could get out without disturbing all the folks, I\u2019d run out and see what it might be! Perhaps I had better bark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do not bark!\u201d Raggedy Andy cried as he put his rag arm around Fido\u2019s nose. \u201cYou will awaken everybody in the house. We can open a door or a window for you and let you out, if you must go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would. Listen! There it is again: \u2018Scratch! Scratch!\u2019 What can it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may soon see!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you out, but please don\u2019t sit at the door and bark and bark to get back in again, as you usually do, for we are going to play a good game and we may not hear you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep out in the shed after you have found out what it is,\u201d said Raggedy Andy.</p><p>As soon as the dolls opened the door for Fido, he went running across the lawn, barking in a loud shrill voice. He ran down behind the shed and through the garden, and then back towards the house again.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-040.jpg'></img><p>Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem stood looking out of the door, the rest of the dolls peeping over their shoulders, so when something came jumping through the door, it hit Uncle Clem and Raggedy Andy and sent them flying against the other dolls behind them.</p><p>All the dolls went down in a wiggling heap on the floor.</p><p>It was surprising that the noise and confusion did not waken Daddy and the rest of the folks, for just as the dolls were untangling themselves from each other and getting upon their feet, Fido came jumping through the door and sent the dolls tumbling again.</p><p>Fido quit barking when he came through the door.</p><p>\u201cWhich way did he go?\u201d he asked, when he could get his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Raggedy Andy asked in return.</p><p>\u201cIt was a rabbit!\u201d Fido cried. \u201cHe ran right in here, for I could smell his tracks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could feel him!\u201d Raggedy Andy laughed.</p><p>\u201cI could not tell you which way he went!\u201d Uncle Clem said, \u201cExcept I feel sure he came through the door and into the house!\u201d</p><p>None of the dolls knew into which room the rabbit had run.</p><p>Finally, after much sniffing, Fido traced the rabbit to the nursery, where, when the dolls followed, they saw the rabbit crouching behind the rocking horse.</p><p>Fido whined and cried because he could not get to the rabbit and bite him.</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself, Fido!\u201d cried Raggedy Ann. \u201cJust see how the poor bunny is trembling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should not come scratching around our house if he doesn\u2019t care to be chased!\u201d said Fido.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-041.jpg'></img><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay out in the woods and fields where you really belong?\u201d Raggedy Andy asked the rabbit.</p><p>\u201cI came to leave some Easter eggs!\u201d the bunny answered in a queer little quavery voice.</p><p>\u201cAn Easter bunny!\u201d all the dolls cried, jumping about and clapping their hands. \u201cAn Easter bunny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d was all Fido could say, as he sat down and began wagging his tail.</p><p>\u201cYou may come out from behind the rocking horse now, Easter bunny!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cFido will not hurt you, now that he knows, will you, Fido?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I won\u2019t!\u201d Fido replied. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I chased you! And I remember now, I had to jump over a basket out by the shed! Was that yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was full of Easter eggs and colored grasses for the little girl who lives here!\u201d the bunny said.</p><p>When the Easter bunny found out that Fido and the dolls were his friends, he came out from behind the rocking horse and hopped across the floor to the door.</p><p>\u201cI must go see if any of the eggs are broken, for if they are, I will have to run home and color some more! I was just about to make a nice nest and put the eggs in it when Fido came bouncing out at me!\u201d</p><p>And with a squeeky little laugh the Easter bunny, followed by Fido and all the dolls, hopped across the lawn towards the shed. There they found the basket. Four of the lovely colored Easter eggs were broken.</p><p>\u201cI will run home and color four more. It will only take a few minutes, so when I return and scratch again to make a nest, please do not bark at me!\u201d said the Easter bunny.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-042.jpg'></img><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I promise!\u201d Fido laughed.</p><p>\u201cMay we go with you and watch you color the Easter eggs?\u201d Raggedy Andy begged.</p><p>\u201cIndeed you may!\u201d the Easter bunny answered. \u201cCan you run fast?\u201d</p><p>Then down through the garden and out through a crack in the fence the Easter bunny hopped, with a long string of dolls trailing behind.</p><p>When they came to the Easter bunny\u2019s home, they found Mama Easter bunny and a lot of little teeny weeny bunnies who would some day grow up to be big Easter bunnies like their Mama and Daddy bunny.</p><p>The Easter bunny told them of his adventure with Fido, and all joined in his laughter when they found it had turned out well at the end.</p><p>The Easter bunny put four eggs on to boil and while these were boiling he mixed up a lot of pretty colors.</p><p>When the eggs were boiled, he dipped the four eggs into the pretty colored dye and then painted lovely flowers on them.</p><p>When the Easter bunny had finished painting the eggs he put them in his basket and, with all the dolls running along beside him, they returned to the house.</p><p>\u201cWhy not make the nest right in the nursery?\u201d Raggedy Andy asked.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-044.jpg'></img><p>\u201cThat would be just the thing! Then the little girl would wonder and wonder how I could ever get into the nursery without awakening the rest of the folks, for she will never suspect that you dolls and Fido let me in!\u201d</p><p>So with Raggedy Andy leading the way, they ran up to the nursery and there, \u2018way back in a corner, they watched the Easter bunny make a lovely nest and put the Easter eggs in it.</p><p>And in the morning when Marcella came in to see the dolls you can imagine her surprise when she found the pretty gift of the Easter bunny.</p><p>\u201cHow in the world did the bunny get inside the house and into this room without awakening Fido?\u201d she laughed.</p><p>And Fido, pretending to be asleep, slowly opened one eye and winked over the edge of his basket at Raggedy Andy.</p><p>And Raggedy Andy smiled back at Fido, but never said a word.</p>"}
