been to the seaside?</p><p>I\u2019m sure that you have.</p><p>Well if you have been to the seaside then you may have noticed those coloured balls that just seem to float in the sea without moving.\u00a0 Remember?</p><p>Those floating balls are called buoys, and they\u2019re anchored to the seabed so that they don\u2019t move.</p><p>It\u2019s a strange word, buoy.</p><p>People say \u201cbuoy\u201d the same as they would say \u201cboy\u201d so it can get a bit confusing, especially if the buoy isn\u2019t actually a boy.</p><p>Now you\u2019re looking confused.</p><p>Anyway, this is the story of one buoy in particular named Billy.</p><p>Billy was a both a buoy and a boy so that should keep things simple because if I said something like \u201cthe buoy was a girl\u201d then you may begin to get things a little bit mixed up.</p><p>Now, for many years Billy the buoy spent his days bobbing up and down in the water without moving from his anchored spot.\u00a0 Some of you may think that splashing around in the sea all day would be great fun, but it was no fun at all for Billy.</p><p>Billy was a very sad buoy.</p><p>He was sad because he felt hollow inside.\u00a0 Although, if you think about it, he actually is hollow inside, but what I mean to say is that Billy felt like there was something missing from his life.</p><p>Basically, Billy was a lonely buoy.</p><p>Billy would see the occasional swimmer during the summer and this would make him smile.</p><p>However, during the winter it was very rare that he would see anyone at all except for the odd boat that came a bit too close and scared him.</p><p>Billy was even more lonely during the winter than he was during the summer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sometimes Billy would see how long a gap there was between each wave.\u00a0 It was a game.\u00a0 The shortest time that he ever recorded was 2 seconds.\u00a0 The longest time that he recorded was 25 seconds, although there were a few mini-waves on that occasion but Billy didn\u2019t really count mini-waves.\u00a0 This was Billy\u2019s favourite game but even this could get a little boring.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Billy would tell himself the occasional joke.\u00a0 But his jokes were very very bad.\u00a0 Here\u2019s just one example:</p><p>\u201cKnock knock\u201d Billy would say to himself.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he would answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me\u201d</p><p>\u201c It\u2019s Me who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u00a0 Billy.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t that a terrible joke?\u00a0 Even if it was a good joke, Billy wouldn\u2019t have laughed because he already knew the punch line.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sammy the Seagull, Billy\u2019s only real friend, would come and land on his head at the start of every month.\u00a0 Sammy never laughed at Billy\u2019s jokes, and he didn\u2019t know the punch lines.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/BUOY2.jpg.jpg'></img><p>\u201cWhy are you so sad?\u201d asked Sammy one day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lonely\u201d said Billy in a very gloomy voice.</p><p>\u201cBut I come to see you every month\u201d said Sammy.</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d said Billy \u201cand it makes me very happy when you come.\u00a0 But I\u2019m lonely when you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Sammy the Seagull thought for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look under the water?\u201d said Sammy.</p><p>Billy Buoy, who as far as he could remember had spent every day of his life on the water, had never thought to look what was actually underneath him in the sea.</p><p>So, with a great effort, Billy ducked his huge head under the water and was amazed at what he saw.</p><p>There were thousands of fish and plants and other creatures.\u00a0 There were yellow fish and orange fish and blue fish and green fish and many other colours too.\u00a0 There was red coral, yellow coral and the darkest shades of seaweed.\u00a0 There were jellyfish, sea horses and many other wonderful creatures.</p><p>Billy laughed to himself when he saw this beautiful sight.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d never seen it before.</p><p>After this, any time that Billy felt lonely he would look under the water and gaze in wonder at the beauty that was surrounding him.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This kept Billy happy for a while but there was a problem.\u00a0 The problem was that Billy couldn\u2019t talk under water and this meant that he couldn\u2019t make friends with the creatures that he saw each day.</p><p>Soon Billy became lonely again with only Sammy the Seagull to talk to once each month.\u00a0 His games and jokes were getting even worse too.\u00a0 Some days he would see how many clouds he could count.\u00a0 This was fun at first but the clouds were always moving and sometimes they stuck together and he couldn\u2019t tell if two clouds were actually one cloud.\u00a0 He soon became confused and stopped playing this game.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He felt empty again, and on a day when he was feeling particularly sorry for himself he felt something underneath him that tickled.</p><p>Billy looked down and could see a large dark figure floating right next to him.\u00a0 It looked like a whale or a seal, and it appeared to be nibbling Billy.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me\u201d said Billy.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d said the animal, lifting his whiskery face out of the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eating\u201d said the animal.</p><p>\u201cEating what?\u201d asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cAlgae\u201d said the creature.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s algae?\u201d asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this green stuff that attached to your bottom\u201d said the animal.</p><p>\u201cIs it some kind of plant?\u201d asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cSimilar, it tastes great but it\u2019s not actually a plant\u201d said the animal.</p><p>\u201cSo do you creatures eat a lot of it?\u201d\u00a0 asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cUs creatures?\u201d said the animal \u201cDon\u2019t you know what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a seal?\u201d\u00a0 asked Billy.</p><p>The animal laughed.\u00a0 \u201cNo, I\u2019m a manatee\u201d said the manatee.</p><p>Now if you don\u2019t know (because a lot of people don\u2019t know) what a manatee is, then I\u2019ll explain.</p><p>Manatees are large water mammals that are sometimes known as \u201csea cows\u201d.\u00a0 They have two short flippers at the front and a large flipper at the back.\u00a0 They have short noses and mainly just eat plants and vegetation but have also been known to eat fish.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Martin\u201d said the manatee.</p><p>\u201cAnd my name is Billy\u201d said the buoy.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Billy,\u201d said Martin \u201cdo you mind if I come to eat algae here tomorrow as well?\u00a0 You see, there aren\u2019t many other manatees in the world and I get very lonely.\u201d</p><p>Billy couldn\u2019t believe his ears, he\u2019d found another lonely person to talk to, or should I say another lonely person had found him.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>From that day on Martin came to eat Billy\u2019s algae every day.</p><p>This was the happiest that Billy had ever been.\u00a0 He had company every day as Martin would come to see Billy and tell him about all of the different things he\u2019d seen swimming around the sea.</p><p>At first Billy loved hearing these tales of adventure as Martin told him about places and creatures that he\u2019d never even heard of.</p><p>However, the feelings of emptiness soon returned and Billy was glum once again.</p><p>Billy felt unfulfilled.\u00a0 He felt that he had not achieved anything in his life.\u00a0 He felt that he had not seen anything in his life.</p><p>He was jealous of Martin\u2019s adventures and wanted to be set free.</p><p>How could his life be of any importance?\u00a0 All he did was bounce up and down in the sea.\u00a0 Billy felt useless.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The next time that Billy saw Martin, he told him how he felt about these things.</p><p>Martin looked shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou must be crazy,\u201d said Martin \u201cdo you not realise what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pointless\u201d said Billy.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d said Martin \u201cyou\u2019re one of the most important residents of this sea, especially to me.\u00a0 You\u2019re a buoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d asked Billy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a buoy, you help to make sure that boats don\u2019t crash into each other.\u00a0 You direct them, which is great for me because I swim so slowly that I struggle to get out of their way, and if you send them one way then I can swim in the other direction.\u00a0 You\u2019re very important.\u201d</p><p>As Martin the manatee was telling Billy this, the hollow feeling inside him seemed to disappear.\u00a0 He was inflated with pride.\u00a0 He was actually important.</p><p>From that day on Billy bobbed up and down in the sea with extra purpose and pride.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel empty any more.\u00a0 He had an important job and he was proud to do it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He also didn\u2019t feel lonely any more either.\u00a0 Martin had been for a trip around the seas and had told other animals to visit Billy and thank him for the great job that he was doing.\u00a0 So then many different animals such as manatees, dolphins, killer whales, and others all came from different places to thank Billy for doing such a great job.</p><p>Although Billy says that it was only sea water, it looked to me like a little tear rolled down Billy\u2019s cheek every time that an animal thanked him for doing such a fine job.</p><p>Billy now also had the chance to try out his jokes on new friends.\u00a0 None of them have laughed yet.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}
