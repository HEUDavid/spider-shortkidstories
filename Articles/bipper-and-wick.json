The hard work made the bears very sleepy, and their yawns could be heard from far away. There was one bear amongst them, however, that had no intention of taking a long winters nap; his name was Bipper, and he didn\u2019t understand the need to sleep for such a long time. It was Bipper\u2019s first winter, and instead of hibernating he wanted to explore the forest for the first time by himself. Bipper was the youngest and smallest bear in his family, and his older siblings never let him forget it. He was constantly teased about his size and age.</p><p>As the bears prepared to enter their den, Bipper stretched his legs and rested next to a pine tree.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fall asleep before we\u2019ve even entered the den, Bipper?\u201d asked one of the older brother bears.</p><p>\u201cJust taking a little break, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Bipper.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been doing much to help out,\u201d said Bipper\u2019s oldest sister. \u201cWhat are you so tired from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that tired, and if you ask me it\u2019s a waste of time to sleep for so long. I would rather be out having fun in the forest,\u201d said Bipper.</p><p>\u201cBipper, even though you\u2019re a bear try not to be such a bear to be around,\u201d said Bipper\u2019s Momma. All of Bipper\u2019s brothers and sisters laughed at Momma bear\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cBipper, in order to be rested for spring time we bears need to hibernate during the winter,\u201d said the Momma bear.</p><p>\u201cYes, Momma,\u201d replied Bipper.</p><p>Bipper kept to himself for the rest of the evening while the other bears prepared to settle down for their long winter nap. Bipper knew once the other bears fell asleep he could leave the den without being noticed. And that\u2019s exactly what Bipper did. After all the other bears began to snore, Bipper quietly sneaked out of the den and into the forest. At first, Bipper was happy with his new found freedom and loved being able to do whatever he wanted. He rolled around in the snow and repeatedly fell to the ground to make snow angels. But after some time passed, Bipper started to feel lonely and missed his family. The berries he was accustomed to eating off the trees were long gone, and he found himself growing very hungry. Bipper had also traveled a great distance, and even though he had a powerful sense of smell, he was finding it hard to find his way back to the den. One evening with nothing but the moonlight above, and a pesky owl repeatedly asking him who he was, Bipper decided it was time to go home for good.</p><p>Suddenly out of nowhere, a horrible creepy sound could be heard close by. The noise startled Bipper, so he looked around to see where it was coming from. He didn\u2019t see anything! The horrible creepy sound could be heard again, and this time Bipper knew it was getting closer.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d asked Bipper. \u201cI\u2019m a bear so you better watch out.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, a little dog peeked at Bipper from behind a tree. It was the little dog stepping on old fallen limbs that was causing the creepy noises. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me, Mr. Bear. I\u2019m just a little dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d said Bipper. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief to hear, but aren\u2019t bears meat eaters?\u201d asked the little dog.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re meat eaters all right, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody,\u201d said Bipper.</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d said the little dog. \u201cI have a family that no longer wants me, and I can\u2019t even get a bear in the middle of the forest to want me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to change my mind?\u201d asked Bipper.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d said the little dog sheepishly. \u201cI was only joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d laughed Bipper. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your kindness,\u201d said the little dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is a little dog like you doing out in the forest anyway? This isn\u2019t a safe place for you to be you know. There really are a lot of animals out here who would hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t the same be said for a little bear?\u201d asked the little dog.</p><p>\u201cNot you too,\u201d said Bipper. Bipper cusped his paw over his face and said, \u201cNow, I have a dog the size of my arm calling me little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou appear to be a very young bear, so I am surprised to see you out here in the forest by yourself. That\u2019s all I meant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am young. And yes, I am a little bear,\u201d said Bipper. \u201cUntil I get older there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I can\u2019t wait until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to grow up so fast?\u201d asked the little dog.</p><p>\u201cI am tired of being teased about my age and size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my grandmother used to say when I was a pup, \u2018Don\u2019t wish your time away, enjoy thy youth\u2019,\u201d said the little dog. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a big old bear before you know it. Years from now you\u2019ll look back and wish you were still a little cub. Earlier you asked me why I am out here; do you still want to know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m curious,\u201d replied Bipper.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am out here because I am an old dog that nobody loves anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say such a thing?\u201d asked Bipper.</p><p>\u201cWell, tomorrow is Christmas day and as an early gift for Christmas my owners bought their children a new puppy. When the kids saw the puppy for the first time it was as if I didn\u2019t even exist anymore,\u201d said the little dog.</p><p>\u201cI am sure they still love you just the same. My Momma always says she has no favorites. She says she loves me and my older siblings equally. Your age will never change how much your family loves you,\u201d said Bipper.</p><p>The little dog nodded his head and said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. What was I thinking? They have loved me my entire life. I know they don\u2019t love me any less than before. I guess I was just jealous about the puppy. You have great wisdom for being such a young bear. Listen to your own advice about family and you won\u2019t be so frustrated about being teased. Take it from an old dog, being young is a wonderful thing so enjoy it and have fun. What\u2019s your name by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBipper, what\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWick\u2019s my name,\u201d said the little dog. Bipper and Wick shook paws, and promised to help one another find their way home.</p><p>To help ease the burden of such a long trek, Bipper and Wick laughed and played in the snow. Much to Bipper\u2019s surprise, however, Wick started to bark out Christmas carols along the way. About a dozen rabbits popped their heads out of their holes to see what was going on. Wick\u2019s singing made every rabbit flap their long ears downward to ease the strain on their eardrums. Since Wick was still engaged in song, one of the rabbits looked over at Bipper and said, \u201cWhat is wrong with that dog? Why is it making so much racket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, he\u2019s just having a little festive fun by singing some Christmas carols,\u201d said Bipper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you call that huh, singing?\u201d asked the rabbit.</p><p>Bipper approached the rabbit and said, \u201cLook, I know this dog can\u2019t sing in tune, but please just bear with me. We\u2019re on our way home and he just wants to spread a little holiday cheer.\u201d</p><p>The rabbit pointed at her hole in the ground and asked Bipper, \u201cYou hear that?\u201d</p><p>Bipper leaned over the rabbit\u2019s hole and said, \u201cYeah, I hear Christmas music playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the rabbit. \u201cI already have all the Christmas music I need, and I\u2019ve got seven more carrot cakes to make before morning. Time\u2019s a wasting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Sorry again about the disturbance and happy holidays to you. We\u2019ll be on our way now,\u201d said Bipper. The rabbit shook her head at Bipper and then dived back in her hole.</p><p>As Bipper and Wick continued their journey through the forest several more animals vented their frustrations to Bipper about Wick\u2019s singing. A squirrel even claimed Wick\u2019s singing caused her peanut cake to turn upside down. Enough was enough! The sound of wick\u2019s singing was so bad Bipper thought it was going wake every animal in the entire forest up. To get the point across to Wick that he needed to quit singing, Bipper reminded him that bears are meat eaters and he would appreciate it if he wouldn\u2019t sing another note. Wick was disappointed that no one appreciated his talent, so he just hummed Christmas carols the rest of the way home.</p>"}
