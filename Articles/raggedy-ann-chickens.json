She was stuffed with nice soft cotton, you see.</p><p>So, there she sat until a tiny little humming-bird, in search of flower honey hummed close to Raggedy Ann\u2019s head and hovered near the tall Hollyhocks.</p><p>Raggedy Ann turned her rag head to see the humming-bird and lost her balance\u2014plump! she went, down amongst the chickens.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s11b.jpg'></img><p>The chickens scattered in all directions, all except Old Ironsides, the rooster.</p><p>He ruffled his neck feathers and put his head down close to the ground, making a queer whistling noise as he looked fiercely at Raggedy Ann.</p><p>But Raggedy Ann only smiled at Old Ironsides, the rooster, and ran her rag hand through her yarn hair for she did not fear him.</p><p>And then something strange happened, for when she made this motion the old rooster jumped up in the air and kicked his feet out in front, knocking Raggedy Ann over and over.</p><p>When Raggedy Ann stopped rolling she waved her apron at the rooster and cried, \u201cShoo!\u201d but instead of \u201cshooing,\u201d Old Ironsides upset her again.</p><p>Now, two old hens who had been watching the rooster jump at Raggedy ran up and as one old hen placed herself before the rooster, the other old hen caught hold of Raggedy\u2019s apron and dragged her into the chicken-coop.</p><p>It was dark inside and Raggedy could not tell what was going on as she felt herself being pulled up over the nests.</p><p>But, finally Raggedy could sit up, for the old hen had quit pulling her, and as her shoe-button eyes were very good, she soon made out the shape of the old hen in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMy! that\u2019s the hardest work I have done in a long time!\u201d said the old hen, when she could catch her breath. \u201cI was afraid Mr. Rooster would tear your dress and apron!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a queer game he was playing, Mrs. Hen,\u201d said Raggedy Ann.</p><p>The old hen chuckled \u2018way down in her throat, \u201cGracious me! He wasn\u2019t playing a game, he was fighting you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting!\u201d cried Raggedy Ann in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, indeed!\u201d the old hen answered, \u201cOld Ironsides, the rooster, thought you intended to harm some of the children chickens and he was fighting you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry that I fell inside the pen, I wouldn\u2019t harm anything,\u201d Raggedy Ann said.</p><p>\u201cIf we tell you a secret you must promise not to tell your mistress!\u201d said the old hens.</p><p>\u201cI promise! Cross my candy heart!\u201d said Raggedy Ann.</p><p>Then the two old hens took Raggedy Ann \u2018way back in the farthest corner of the chicken coop. There, in back of a box, they had built two nests and each old hen had ten eggs in her nest.</p><p>\u201cIf your folks hear of it they will take the eggs!\u201d said the hens, \u201cand then we could not raise our families!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s11c.jpg'></img><p>Raggedy Ann felt the eggs and they were nice and warm.</p><p>\u201cWe just left the nests when you fell into the pen!\u201d explained the old hens.</p><p>\u201cBut how can the eggs grow if you sit upon them?\u201d said Raggedy. \u201cIf Fido sits on any of the garden, the plants will not grow, Mistress says!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs are different!\u201d one old hen explained. \u201cIn order to make the eggs hatch properly, we must sit on them three weeks and not let them get cold at any time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd at the end of the three weeks do the eggs sprout?\u201d asked Raggedy Ann.</p><p>\u201cYou must be thinking of eggplant!\u201d cried one old hen. \u201cThese eggs hatch at the end of three weeks\u2014they don\u2019t sprout\u2014and then we have a lovely family of soft downy chickies; little puff balls that we can cuddle under our wings and love dearly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been sitting upon the eggs very long?\u201d Raggedy asked.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us has kept track of the time,\u201d said one hen. \u201cSo we do not know! You see, we never leave the nests only just once in a while to get a drink and to eat a little. So we can hardly tell when it is day and when it is night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going out to get a drink when you fell in the pen!\u201d said one old hen. \u201cNow we will have to sit upon the eggs and warm them up again!\u201d</p><p>The two old hens spread their feathers and nestled down upon the nests.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get them good and warm, I would be glad to sit upon the eggs to keep them warm until you get something to eat and drink!\u201d said Raggedy. So the two old hens walked out of the coop to finish their meal which had been interrupted by Raggedy\u2019s fall and while they were gone, Raggedy Ann sat quietly upon the warm eggs. Suddenly down beneath her she heard something go, \u201cPick, pick!\u201d \u201cI hope it isn\u2019t a mouse!\u201d Raggedy Ann said to herself, when she felt something move. \u201cI wish the old hens would come back.\u201d But when they came back and saw the puzzled expression on her face, they cried, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s11e.jpg'></img><p>Raggedy Ann got to her feet and looked down and there were several little fluffy, cuddly baby chickies, round as little puff-balls.</p><p>\u201cCheep! Cheep! Cheep!\u201d they cried when Raggedy stepped out of the nest.</p><p>\u201cBaby Chicks!\u201d Raggedy cried, as she stooped and picked up one of the little puff-balls. \u201cThey want to be cuddled!\u201d</p><p>The two old hens, their eyes shining with happiness, got upon the nests and spread out their soft warm feathers, \u201cThe other eggs will hatch soon!\u201d said they.</p><p>So, for several days Raggedy helped the two hens hatch out the rest of the chickies and just as they finished, Marcella came inside looking around.</p><p>\u201cHow in the world did you get in here, Raggedy Ann?\u201d she cried. \u201cI have been looking all about for you! Did the chickens drag you in here?\u201d</p><p>Both old hens down behind the box clucked softly to the chickies beneath them and Marcella overheard them.</p><p>She lifted the box away and gave a little squeal of surprise and happiness.</p><p>\u201cOh you dear old Hennypennies!\u201d she cried, lifting both old hens from their nests. \u201cYou have hidden your nests away back here and now you have one, two, three, four\u2014twenty chickies!\u201d and as she counted them, Marcella placed them in her apron; then catching up Raggedy Ann, she placed her over the new little chickies.</p><p>\u201cCome on, old Hennypennies!\u201d she said, and went out of the coop with the two old hens clucking at her heels.</p><p>Marcella called Daddy and Daddy rolled two barrels out under one of the trees and made a nice bed in each. Then he nailed slats across the front, leaving a place for a door. Each Hennypennie was then given ten little chickies and shut up in the barrel. And all the dolls were happy when they heard of Raggedy\u2019s adventure and they did not have to wait long before they were all taken out to see the new chickies.</p>"}
