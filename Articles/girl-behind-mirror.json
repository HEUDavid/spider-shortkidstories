Look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d replied Lucy\u2019s mum. \u201cWe need to get home. It\u2019s so foggy out, it\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting little shop down that alleyway,\u201d Lucy continued. \u201cCan we take a quick look? Pleeease? Maybe we\u2019ll find a dressing table in there?\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s mum sighed. They had just spent a whole morning looking for dressing table for Lucy\u2019s room, to no avail. Everything they looked at had not been good enough for Lucy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too small!\u201d she complained about one of them that looked perfect to mum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dark!\u201d she argued when shown a perfectly acceptable one, according to mum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too boring!\u201d she cried when mum tried to convince her about a very sensible option she had recommended.</p><p>Mum had given up trying to convince her of anything and they were walking home, frustrated at the wasted morning. The newly descending fog just added to the gloom. She looked down the alley to where Lucy was pointing.</p><p>\u201cFunny, I never saw that lane before and I must have passed here hundreds of times,\u201d said Mum. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly a dresser in that old place. It looks like an old junk shop if you ask me. If there is one in there, unlikely as it is, it\u2019ll be filthy and falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Xu\u2019s Chinese Emporium, it says on the sign,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cIt sounds kind of exciting. Let\u2019s have a quick look. We\u2019ll know within a minute if it has one.\u201d</p><p>Mum sighed with exasperation but gave in. They had been looking for weeks to find Lucy a dresser with a mirror now that she was getting older and needed one. She followed Lucy down the alleyway, more in desperation than hope.</p><p>Lucy pushed the door open, which immediately set off a bell somewhere in the back of the shop. She pushed in and almost immediately collided with a tall urn her own size. It started to wobble but she managed to stabilise it before it keeled over.</p><p>\u201cThat was close,\u201d said Lucy in relief. \u201cI nearly broke the Ming vase!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness, Lucy,\u201d replied Mum. \u201cWe\u2019d be paying that back for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>They looked around the shop. It was actually quite bright, and remarkably long. In fact, the back of the shop disappeared way into the distance. The shop was crammed with all sorts of oriental-looking items. Tall urns. Clocks. Decorations of all types. Items of furniture. Shelves of dishes, pots and bowls. Fancy seats and couches. It went on and on.</p><p>\u201cLook, the shop owner is back there behind a desk. Let\u2019s go ask him about dressers!\u201d said Lucy. Before mum could say anything, Lucy had motored to the back of the shop and approached a large, round, elderly oriental-looking man sitting behind a desk. He had a long wispy white beard, a bald head and a big smiling face. He looked up.</p><p>\u201cLucy looking for nice dresser with big mirror, no?\u201d said the man to Lucy.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d asked Lucy in alarm. \u201cOr that I wanted a dresser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he overheard us as we came in,\u201d said Mum breathlessly, catching up just behind her.</p><p>The man stood up and bowed.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Dr. Xu. Always possible to find what you are looking for in my Chinese Emporium,\u201d he said, waving his arm around to highlight the extent of his offerings in the shop. \u201cFollow me, I know exact thing you need.\u201d</p><p>They followed nervously as he made his way to the back far right-hand corner of the shop, through a narrow aisle cluttered on both sides with sideboards and display cabinets inlaid with the most beautiful patterns. He stood back and indicated with his hands where to look.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d he said, smiling even more broadly. \u201cI have been keeping it for you.\u201d</p><p>Lucy gasped, ignoring his curious statement. It was the most beautiful dresser she had ever laid eyes on, with a beautiful mahogany top and drawers and a large rectangular mirror mounted within a gold-patterned border. There was a small brass plate set into the wood below the mirror engraved with the words:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Get to know your Reflection.</em></strong></p><p>Lucy turned to Mum.</p><p>\u201cMum! It\u2019s perfect! This is exactly the one I wa\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the question, Lucy,\u201d Mum interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can afford this. It\u2019s way out of our price range.\u201d</p><p>Lucy turned to Dr. Xu. \u201cDr. Xu. Please tell us how much this costs?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Xu beamed at them. \u201cToday is special offer. We sell this dresser to you for \u20ac20.\u201d</p><p>Mum look shocked. \u201cTwenty euro? Why that\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s no way it could be that price. We\u2019ve looked at dressers all morning and they are all at least\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady drive hard bargain,\u201d interrupted the shop keeper. \u201cOK, I make deal with you. Take today and I give you for \u20ac15. But that is best offer. Leave or take it.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at Mum. Mum looked at Lucy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it!\u201d they both replied.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Later that evening, Lucy was in her bedroom, sitting at her new dresser, running her fingers over the smooth mahogany. Finally, something to take her mind off the awful purple-spotted wallpaper she had mistakenly chosen for her bedroom in a fit of \u201cartiness\u201d. She couldn\u2019t help smiling at herself in the mirror. She looked again at the engraving on the brass plate.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Get to know your Reflection</em></strong></p><p>What a curious inscription, she thought to herself. I wonder why it\u2019s there? Well, I should at least try to get to know it, she concluded.</p><p>Lucy stared at herself in the mirror. She started to count her freckles. It was so great to finally have her own mirror in her own room. Now she could study herself in detail without others thinking she was vain or strange. After several minutes, she concluded that she had twice as many freckles on the right side of her face as compared to the left side.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/reflection-opt.jpg'></img><p>Isn\u2019t it funny that everything is reversed in the mirror? she thought to herself. On my reflection\u2019s face the extra freckles are on her left side, not on the right. What a funny world it would be to have everything on the opposite side to normal. I\u2019d be left-handed and not right-handed I presume. And my bed would be on the left side of the room and not the right. In fact, the whole room would be opposite to my real room. </p><p>\u00a0She moved her face closer to the mirror to examine the freckles in more detail. She leaned in closer. Her breath was fogging the mirror, clouding her view of her own face. She wiped in and held her breath, leaning in closer, until her forehead was almost touching the glass.</p><p>Lucy leaned so far forward that she lost her balance and fell towards the glass. Her head bumped against the surface of the mirror and against the forehead of her reflection.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d asked Lucy, looking around the room. \u201cWho said Ouch?\u201d</p><p>She looked in the mirror. A shocked version of herself was looking back at her. She stepped back. Her reflection stepped back. But not at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAm I seeing what I think I\u2019m seeing?\u201d asked Lucy.</p><p>\u201cAm I seeing what I think I am seeing?\u201d replied her reflection two seconds later.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really strange,\u201c said Lucy. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you are not my reflection but a separate person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is strange,\u201c replied her reflection. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking too.\u201d</p><p>They stood and gaped at one another. Lucy lifted a hand a waved it, to check if the reflection would do the same thing. Her reflection waved back.</p><p>\u201cStop copying me,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cDo something of your own to prove you are not just a delayed reflection.\u201d</p><p>Her reflection started dancing on the spot, waving hand and arms left and right. Lucy watched in amazement, dumbstruck by what was happening.</p><p>It must be some sort of enchanted dresser, thought Lucy, with excitement. She wasn\u2019t nervous at all.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked her reflection. \u201cHow did this happen? I was just minding my own business, checking out my freckle count, when suddenly this happens. I never expected to meet my own reflection! I can\u2019t believe this old dresser from the Chinese Emporium can do this!</p><p>\u201cYour reflection? Excuse me, I\u2019m the real Lucy and YOU are only the reflection, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d replied the reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s you that is the reflection to me. So you were at the Chinese Emporium too? This is getting freakier and freakier. Funny I didn\u2019t meet you there. Then again, if there was only one dresser, we might have fought over it.\u201d</p><p>Lucy was gob-smacked. Not only was she having a conversation with her reflection, it actually thought IT was the real Lucy and that SHE was only a reflection. The sheer cheek of it!</p><p>\u201cListen, eh reflection Lucy or whatever your name is,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cthis is just too freaky. I am going to switch out the light and go to bed. In the morning, I hope this will all have been a bad dream. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Before her reflection could reply, she turned her back to the mirror and strode over to the light switch. She switched it off and went over to the window to draw the curtains. The room was in complete darkness, so she had to change into her pajamas in the dark and ended up putting them on backwards. She turned her back to the mirror, pulled the covers over her head and closed her eyes as tightly as she could.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy, but Lucy finally drifted off to sleep some time later. At some stage before she dropped off, she thought she might have heard a soft \u201cGoodnight\u201d from somewhere, but decided it must have been her mother from outside the room, realising the room was dark and not wanting to wake her.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>The next morning Lucy woke early and immediately remembered her experience with the new mirror and dresser. It seemed so real, and yet it could only have been a dream.</p><p>She decided to confront her fear straight away. A quick check at the mirror that everything was normal and then down to breakfast.</p><p>She hopped out of her bed, walked over to the dresser and turned to face the mirror.</p><p>She saw herself looking back. She nodded her head and her reflection nodded back at exactly the same time. She waved a hand and the reflection responded. She jumped up and down and left and right. The reflection did the same. It really was just a plain, old mirror.</p><p>Phew, thought Lucy. What a vivid dream last night.</p><p>After a long day at school and an evening at her friend\u2019s house, Lucy was finally at home in her bedroom getting ready for bed. She was in front of the dresser again, leaning in examining her freckles.</p><p>So many freckles, she thought. Why can\u2019t I have as many on the left as I do on the right? I look so unbalanced.</p><p>She looked again at the mirror and thought again about the reflection having everything on the opposite side.\u00a0 The reflection looked so normal to her.</p><p>I guess that\u2019s because I only see a reflection of myself normally in all mirrors, never my real self, she thought.</p><p>She leaned in closer to the mirror. She reached out both hands towards the surface of the mirror and put her palms against the glass. It was funny. It didn\u2019t feel like glass. It felt more like \u2013 someone\u2019s hands!</p><p>Lucy screamed. Without thinking, her hands went through the mirror and grabbed the wrists of her reflection in automatic response. She jerked back in shock, still holding on and fell back. She was terrified when she realised that as she fell back she had pulled her entire reflection out of the mirror by the arms. As she fell backwards and landed on the floor, her reflection tumbled over the desk and landed on top of her with a huge shriek.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d screamed her reflection. \u201cWhat just happened to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d screamed Lucy, backing away on the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pulled me in here,\u201d replied the reflection, starting to sit up. \u201cPlease tell me this is just a nightmare? I had a dream last night I bumped foreheads with my reflection in the mirror, but this is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reflection?\u201d responded Lucy. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m the real Lucy and you are my reflection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d replied the reflection. \u201cFor example, I was at school all day while you were doing nothing behind the mirror,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was at school all day myself,\u201d replied Lucy. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no matter, I don\u2019t like it here. It\u2019s too freaky, everything is the wrong way around. For example, my bed should be on the left part of the room, not the right. And your freckles are totally in the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove you are my reflection,\u201d replied Lucy. \u201cLet\u2019s both look in the mirror at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Her reflection looked at her for a moment, very suspiciously. Then she nodded.</p><p>\u201cOk then. Let\u2019s resolve this once and for all. To the mirror.\u201d</p><p>They both got off the floor, walked towards the mirror and looked into it. Their faces dropped and they turned to look at one another.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reflection!\u201d they chimed in unison.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/together-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cYou were my reflection in the mirror, and now you are standing in my room. Super freaky!\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection suddenly started to sob.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d asked Lucy.</p><p>Her reflection tried to gather herself. She used her arm to clear the tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAm I stuck here? My mum and dad are on the other side of the mirror. I hope I can get back?\u201d</p><p>Lucy ran over to the mirror and pressed against the surface with her hand. All she felt was regular glass. She pressed her forehead against it. Just the normal feel of the surface of a mirror.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I try it will work,\u201d said her reflection. She approached the mirror and touched it with her hands. She slapped the mirror and bumped her head against it. Nothing. It was behaving like a normal mirror. She started sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>She looked up at Lucy.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she said.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Lucy and her reflection slipped out of the house and down the road, back towards where the lane with the Chinese Emporium had been. They had spoken for hours about what to do. Lucy thought they couldn\u2019t tell their parents. Or Lucy\u2019s parents, as her reflection didn\u2019t see them as her parents, who were actually a reflected version of Lucy\u2019s parent\u2019s behind the mirror. Anyway, Lucy thought it would be too much of a shock to her parents to tell them that a reflected Lucy had come through the mirror into her room. They decided to go back to the shop and speak to Dr. Xu. Maybe he\u2019d know what to do.</p><p>They stole down the road, keeping into the shadows as much as possible. Lucy\u2019s reflection wore a hat and sunglasses and one of Lucy\u2019s jackets so she wouldn\u2019t look exactly the same as Lucy.</p><p>The strangest thing, though, no matter how much they searched, they could not find the shop.</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely about here,\u201d said Lucy, exasperated. \u201cI mean, it was a foggy day, so it\u2019s hard to be completely sure, but it has to be around here somewhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was a magic shop,\u201d replied the reflection. \u201cMaybe just because it was foggy,\u201d some magic came down. I mean, it\u2019s fairly unusual that you buy a dresser with a mirror that you can fall into and hang out with your reflection. So, it\u2019s probably not an ordinary shop.\u201d</p><p>They continued to search for over an hour, but to no avail. They decided to go back home and see if they could figure it out.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Lucy let herself into the house with her key, and when she saw the coast was clear, she ushered in her reflection and they both hurried up the stairs and back into her room.</p><p>\u201cNow what are we going to do?\u201d asked her reflection, and started to cry again. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get home or be with my real mum and dad again.\u201d</p><p>Lucy hugged her and stroked her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Lucy,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. If you were able to come through into my side, you must be able to get back into yours again!\u201d</p><p>Later that evening, Lucy went down for tea with her mum and dad and smuggled lots of food back up afterwards.</p><p>\u201cI told them I was tired and needed an early night,\u201d she told her reflection. \u201cThey were pleased I was being so \u2018sensible\u2019. I brought you some lovely leftovers.\u201d</p><p>She handed over a plate of ham sandwiches, biscuits and a tall glass of milk, her favourite tea. Lucy grabbed it and devoured it hungrily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said. \u201cNormally I have my tea by now.\u201d</p><p>They spent the rest of the evening trying to get Lucy\u2019s reflection back through the mirror. They tried everything. Bumping heads. Arms first. Looking around the back of the mirror to see if there was a way in there. But it was behaving just like a normal, run-of-the-mill dresser mirror. There appeared to be no way back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI have a mat and a sleeping bag and a spare pillow. Why don\u2019t you sleep under the bed so no one sees you? I sometimes sleep in there myself and pretend I am sleeping in a cave. Things always work out better after a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>And so, Lucy made up a little sleeping area under the bed with a comfy mat, a sleeping bag and a nice soft pillow. Lucy\u2019s reflection yawned and agreed to go in, too tired and sad to argue any more with her situation.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, if we don\u2019t figure it out, we\u2019ll tell my parents,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cThey\u2019ll know what to do. They\u2019re grown-ups.\u201d</p><p>After they settled down for the night, Lucy reached over and switched off the lights. Within minutes they were both asleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>The next morning was a Saturday, so Lucy didn\u2019t have to go to school. At first when she woke up, she didn\u2019t even think of the events with the mirror. But then suddenly it came back to her. She spun around and looked under the bed. She immediately saw her reflection looking out, eyes wide open.</p><p>\u201cNot a dream,\u201d they both said, in unison.</p><p>Lucy hopped out of the bed and ran to the window. She could barely see out, it was so foggy.</p><p>\u201cAnother foggy day,\u201d said Lucy.</p><p>Her reflection sat up suddenly and bumped her head against the underside of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d asked Lucy. \u201cThat sounded sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d replied her reflection, crawling out from under more carefully. \u201cVery.\u201d She rubbed her head on the bump she had just received.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d said the reflection. \u201cYou said it\u2019s foggy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied Lucy, \u201cjust like the day we bought the\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d interrupted her reflection. \u201cIt was foggy the day we came across Dr. Xu\u2019s Chinese Emporium, even though we\u2019ve been down that street a million times and never saw it. We HAVE to go back and see if it\u2019s there today. Perhaps it only comes out when it\u2019s foggy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI\u2019ll get us some breakfast and then we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s parents had to go out shopping and told her they\u2019d be back in two hours, which was perfect. Once they were gone, both Lucy\u2019s went downstairs and had a big breakfast of heaps of pancakes and bacon. Then they dressed up differently again and headed out into the fog. It wasn\u2019t long before they were standing by the alleyway. Down the alley, they could see the sign for Dr. Xu\u2019s Chinese Emporium.</p><p>\u201cWe found it!\u201d cried Lucy. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and speak to Dr. Xu! He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>They held hands and rushed down the alley towards the shop.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>They burst into the shop, Lucy\u2019s reflection first, Lucy straight behind her. They nearly overturned the large urn on the way in, but Lucy managed to catch and straighten it just in time.</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn that urn was on the other side of the door last time,\u201d said Lucy\u2019s reflection.</p><p>\u201cWell everything is reversed, silly,\u201d replied Lucy. \u201cLook, he\u2019s down the back. Let\u2019s go down and speak to Dr. Xu.\u201d</p><p>They ran down to the end of the shop where Dr. Xu was sitting back on his chair reading a large hardback book. When he heard them, he looked up in surprise, looking at each of them in turn. First at Lucy. Then at her reflection. Then back at Lucy. Then at her reflection again. This went on for quite a while. He looked like a man watching a tennis match. Finally, a beaming smile broke out on his face and he stood up.</p><p>\u201cGet to know reflection!\u201d he cried. \u201cYes. I remember dresser with mirror, no?\u201d</p><p>The two of them tumbled out their story, taking turns to fill in all the details. It went all the way through when Lucy\u2019s reflection first came through the mirror, trying to get back in, searching for the shop but not finding the lane, sleeping overnight under the bed and right up to the present moment.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d finished Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cPlease tell me how I can get back through the mirror to my own side please.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Xu\u2019s mouth opened, as if he was about to say something, but then closed again.</p><p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlways foggy outside when I am in shop.\u201d And with that he sat down.</p><p>\u201cBut Dr. Xu? You didn\u2019t answer the question. How does my reflection get back to her side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cI never see that done before.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection started to cry. It was all hopeless and she was stuck in a strange reverse world, forever.</p><p>\u201cThink, Dr. Xu, think!\u201d demanded Lucy. \u201cWhere did you get that dresser we bought and how does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that was only model,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Lucy frowned. \u201cPity it didn\u2019t come with a manual!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Xu looked at Lucy.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, manual. I have here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at her reflection, who looked back with a glimmer of hope creeping into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a manual?\u201d she asked. \u201cFind it now!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNow where did I throw it?\u201d mumbled Dr. Xu to himself, rifling through a very messy drawer of the desk he stood behind. \u201cMust be in here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Lucy and her reflection could barely contain their impatience as they watched Dr. Xu check all the drawers, several presses and an old cupboard full of junk.\u00a0 Then Lucy noticed it.</p><p>\u201cLook over there,\u201d she cried at Dr. Xu. \u201cThere\u2019s a shelf over there labeled \u2018Manuals\u2019. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Xu looked around in surprise at where Lucy was pointing.</p><p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI forgot that.\u201d</p><p>He went over and leafed through the manuals until at last he found what he was looking for. He came back to the desk and triumphantly threw a pamphlet down. The girls got excited at the title when they read it:</p><p>Reflecto-Magic 9000 Dresser-Mirror Combo</p><p>There was a picture on the front of it of a man shaking hands with his reflection through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cThe manual \u2013 I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s a manual! Thank you so much, Dr. Xu. You are a genius!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very handy to have manual,\u201d he said modestly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run back to the house and figure this thing out with the manual,\u201d said Lucy.</p><p>They were dashing out of the front of the shop before Dr. Xu could say \u201cmind the urn!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Not long later, they were sitting in front of the mirror, manual in hand.</p><p>\u201cTo activate reflection connection, touch against mirror,\u201d read Lucy. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to us!\u201d cried Lucy. \u201cI bumped my forehead against the mirror as I examined my freckles and I felt your forehead against mine. I must have activated this connection to the reflected world when my forehead touched it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was me bumping my head against the mirror, not you, but let\u2019s not split hairs,\u201d replied her reflection. \u201cBut how did I end up in here on the other side?\u201c</p><p>Lucy read on: \u201cOnce reflection activation has been triggered, the reflection portal is open for 5 minutes. It is possible to pass items through the portal during this period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for 5 minutes,\u201d said Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cThat\u2019s why in the morning it looked like a normal mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I touched it with my hands again,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cThen I accidentally pulled you through after I touched the mirror and re-activated the portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then afterwards when we touched it again, nothing happened. So, touching the mirror to activate the portal doesn\u2019t work any more,\u201d said Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cSomehow it\u2019s broken.\u201d She started to sob again. \u201cI really am stuck here so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up so soon,\u201d replied Lucy. \u201cLet\u2019s read the rest of the manual.\u201d</p><p>They looked through the manual but couldn\u2019t find anything in main sections of the manual that explained how to get Lucy\u2019s reflection back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the troubleshooting section,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cMaybe there will be a hint in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste of time,\u201d replied her reflection. \u201cTrouble-shooting guides never have any useful information when you are trying to solve a problem. They never cover the problem you are trying to solve.\u201d</p><p>Lucy stubbornly kept looking through the trouble-shooting section at the back of the manual and leafed through all the problems it described.</p><p>Suddenly, Lucy saw it in big red writing:</p><p>She showed it to her reflection.</p><p>\u201cEr, what does that mean?\u201d asked Lucy\u2019s reflection.</p><p>\u201cI think it means we broke it,\u201d replied Lucy. \u201cBy you coming all the way through, we broke it.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection threw herself on the bed and started to sob again. Lucy handed her a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cThis crying thing is getting out of hand,\u201d said Lucy. She sat at the side of the bed and continued to read the troubleshooting guide.</p><p>\u201cWait! Here it is! Look!\u201d cried Lucy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asked her reflection, managing to look doubtful and hopeful at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an entry in the trouble-shooting guide for What to do if reflection passes through mirror!\u201d she cried triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>Lucy read carefully from the manual.</p><p>\u201cIf reflection accidentally passes through reflection portal, this will disable the reflection flux capacitation adapter mechanism. This is very bad, as it is not possible through the standard method of touching mirror to reactivate as the flux capacitor circuit has been almost completely destroyed due to overload from the reflection passing through the reflection portal magnetic field. Some models are fitted with a one-use only emergency Reflection Return Button (RRB) which will temporarily provide enough power to the reflection flux capacitation adapter mechanism for one second only to activate the reflection portal. Once one second is over, the capacitor is completely blown and the reflection portal will be closed forever and cannot be reactivated.\u201d</p><p>Lucy and her reflection looked at each other what seemed like a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the Reflection Return Button?\u201d said Lucy\u2019s reflection.</p><p>Lucy looked again at the manual.</p><p>\u201cHer it is!\u201d said Lucy. \u201cThere\u2019s a diagram with a red button on the inside of the top drawer, on the left-hand side towards the back.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection ran to the desk and pulled the drawer open roughly. There indeed, at the back left-hand side of the drawer, was a red button with the letters RRB on it. She turned to face Lucy.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Drawer-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cOne second!\u201d said Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough time to climb back through,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ll never make it in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d replied Lucy. Simple. You start at the back of the room and run towards the dresser and jump through the mirror. I\u2019ll press the button just before you hit the mirror. You\u2019ll pass through and land on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the button doesn\u2019t work?\u201d asked Lucy\u2019s reflection. \u201cI\u2019ll crash into the mirror and the glass will shatter. I would smash my head.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at her reflection with caring in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous, and scary. I\u2019d be terrified too. But it sounds like the only way you are getting home. Otherwise \u2013 you are never going back.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection stared at Lucy, then walked over the window and looked out. She sat on the bed and said nothing for what seemed to Lucy like an eternity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna start the waterworks again, are ya?\u201d asked Lucy.</p><p>Her reflection shook her head and stared at the bed some more. Finally, she got up, walked back over and looked Lucy in the eye.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>They talked it over for several minutes. Lucy\u2019s reflection was going to start on the far side of the room and run as fast as possible towards the dresser. She would jump head-first towards the mirror as soon as she reached the dresser. Lucy was to wait to the side, drawer out and finger on the RRB button. She would press it as soon as she was in the air. One second should be just enough for her to pass through the mirror before the portal closed forever. She really hoped that pressing the button would work instantly. If there was any delay, then Lucy\u2019s reflections head would smash against the mirror and goodness knows what would be the outcome.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked Lucy. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work you could do yourself a terrible injury!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut what choice to I have? I have to get home to my family.\u201d</p><p>They squared up to face one another and smiled. Lucy stepped forward and gave her reflection a great hug.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice to meet you,\u201d said Lucy, choking up a little. \u201cI\u2019ll be sad when you go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d replied her reflection. \u201cIt was very special. It was like having a nearly-twin sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d continued Lucy, \u201cnow that we\u2019ve met, we\u2019ll still be able to see each other through the mirror in future. I know now you are a real person and not just a reflection in the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll never forget that, Lucy. Now, it\u2019s time for me to go.\u201d</p><p>Lucy moved over the drawer and got her finger on the RRB button. Her reflection moved to the opposite wall and turned to face the dresser.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll count down from three and then you start sprinting,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cGood luck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You take care,\u201d replied her reflection.</p><p>Lucy paused for a moment and then started counting.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGO!\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s reflection bolted across the room. It took Lucy by surprise how quickly she made it across to the dresser. As she leaped headlong towards the mirror, Lucy smashed down on the button. She held her breath. She couldn\u2019t look. She closed her eyes and waited to hear the smashing sound.</p><p>After a few seconds, all was quiet. Lucy opened her eyes. There was no smashed glass. No bleeding head lying in a big heap moaning. It was eerily quiet.</p><p>She crept towards the mirror and looked anxiously into it. She saw\u2026</p><p>Her reflection! Lucy smiled instinctively, and her reflection smiled back at the exact same time. Lucy winked and her reflection winked. Lucy waved and her reflection waved.</p><p>Lucy touched the mirror to check and see if she could touch her reflection. She just felt the glass. No amount of pressing with hands, forehead, face made any difference. She backed away from the dresser, still looking at her reflection.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/reflection-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to speak to you every day and tell you everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cAnd I hope you do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">THE END</p>"}
