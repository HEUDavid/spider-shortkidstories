Safe and secure, it is nestled under an old potting shed, overgrown and taken back by the forest.</p><p>Here amongst the tired mix, lived four elderly groundhogs. Reunited after a long life of hard work and rearing of children, the four friends seemed mildly pleased, and somewhat content with the fact, that this is where they will live out their lives in peace and quiet. Until one day\u2026</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****</p><p>Jeffrey, had always been a painter, and was quite proud of the grand and opulent dwellings that he had embellished through the years. Daryl was an Indian Chief with great responsibilities until now, but he did still retain humble respect from amongst his tribe. Stanley had been a postman who had delivered mail with steadfast loyalty to every creature, common and royal. And Valeriano. Although a constant seeker of fun and frolic, he had worked in a shop of wood creations.</p><p>After an exhausting day of arts and crafts, classic cinema, and balloon volleyball, the four friends sat reading by the fire. Every now and then, they would silently study each other\u00a0from behind a good book or the daily papers.</p><p>\u201cWhat day is it anyway?\u201d Stanley asked.</p><p>\u201cIn\u00a0this place\u2026 it doesn\u2019t much matter!\u201d replied Val.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s up for a good game of something-or-other?\u201d asked Jeffrey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d said Daryl.</p><p>\u201cHey-hey, maybe not.\u201d said Stanley. He kept reading.</p><p>\u201cIf its cards again, count me out!\u201d said Val, as he crossed his legs and turned the page of \u201cThe Daily Dirt\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell aren\u2019t we the merry bunch!\u201d said Jeff as he dropped his book to the floor and removed his reading glasses. The others payed no mind. Then Jeff continued\u2026 \u201cA breath or two away from \u201cthe big sleep\u201d, and here we are then!\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, then a deep burp from one, and a short trumpety fart from another. This, drew a brief chuckle from all, but Jeff. With the usual frustration, he wasn\u2019t at all amused, and he wasn\u2019t giving up either. He quickly shot up and said\u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s look up old Becky, Lorinda, Debbie and Renee. We can head out and\u2026 trip the lite fantastic!\u201d (A night of dancing out on the town) Still, there was no reaction.</p><p>Jeff let out a heavy sigh, as not a one of the old boys made a sound, or even looked away from their reading.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something!\u201d he thought. \u201cSomething to turn around this hum-drum day\u201d.</p><p>Just then, a fellow resident came strolling slowly by, quietly singing to himself the saddest of songs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not half the man I used to be. Oh yesterday, came suddenly.\u201d</p><p>And that was it. Up, sprang Jeff from his chair! The other boys dropped their reading and watched as he danced a silly jig, and cried\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s absolutely it! That\u2019s positively, unequivocally, without a doubt, they\u2019ll twist and shout! That\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>Stanley was the first to speak as Jeffrey danced about.</p><p>\u201cHey-hey, what is? What\u2019s positively it?\u201d Daryl and Val were interested now, as they both sat up in their chairs and scratched their heads.</p><p>\u201cThe band!\u201d cried Jeff. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the old band back together! The New Day Underground!\u201d</p><p>Stan and Val slid back in their chairs and picked up their papers. But not Daryl. His eyes grew a little bigger as he pulled his tobacco pouch, and loaded his pipe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got my bass guitar.\u201d he said, as he lit the pipe and blew a perfect ring of smoke into the face of Val, who waved and coughed and said\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s preposterous man! Are you quite mad? Are we not too old and slow for that sort of thing? Surely we\u2019ve forgotten all the words of songs, and even, how to play guitar!\u201d This only made Jeffrey all the more determined to roust the boys and do it!</p><p>\u201cOne is never too old for music!\u201d he said. \u201cMusic is art! Music is timeless! The words will come back! You\u2019ll see. And playing guitar is like\u2026 riding a bicycle, you never forget how! Come on Stan, pull out the old drum kit! Come on Val! I know you\u2019ve still got the old \u201caxe\u201d in your closet. Let\u2019s give it a go man! Let\u2019s give it a go!\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the four old comrades slipped off into a daydream of sorts. Their minds went back to a time when they were young teens. The band would rehearsed in Debbie\u2019s garage, with friends all hanging about, singing along and having great fun. And then, there was the performance in the \u201cBattle of The Bands\u201d at the Great Fair. Not to mention all of the concerts at Jolly Road Park, and the many school graduation parties.</p><p>And just when their hearts had come to light with these grand old memories, it all abruptly stopped! Their faces drew a blank, as they then recalled how their young lives were interrupted when they were sent off to fight in the \u201cGreat Orchard War.\u201d</p><p>It was a sad and tragic time that was set back in the minds of all, and rarely if ever spoken of. They sat in silence for a long moment, and then\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d said Stanley.</p><p>\u201cYou can count me in!\u201d said Daryl.</p><p>And then, all eyes were on Val. Always the holdout, Val had to think just a few seconds longer before he said\u2026 \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it! But I insist we let Gordon back in the band!\u201d (Gordon was the founder of the band, but an angry sort of fellow that pouted and bullied)</p><p>\u201cAlright if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d said Jeff. \u201cWe\u2019ll look him up!\u201d And with that, they all scurried off to pull out their gear, and pass the word on to the girls.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chapter\u00a0Two</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Gordon the Copper</em></h2><p>The next day, the boys got together and set off. Cross the sunflower fields, and through the apple orchards. Then down around the edge of town, behind the old the flour mill. Back in the day when they were young, a trip like this was a hop, skip and jump for them. But now, it had taken an hour or more, as they stopped several times to rest from sore ankles and aching backs.</p><p>Only Daryl was in the best of shape. He scurried ahead with great ease. And as always, his sharp eye, and keen senses, were invaluable for the safety of all.</p><p>Under the stone slab of the old mill was the borough of their one time bandmate, Gordon. Not as much a likable character, and nowhere near as sociable as the others, his chosen path in life was that of a policeman (Now retired of course).</p><p>After a quick knock, and a pull of the bell, the door swung quickly open. And there, was their old mate. Standing tall with a firm, serious expression, he held a Billy club under his arm. And, he was sporting a clean, crisp, sergeant\u2019s uniform. His eyes grew large at the sight of his old mates. And he spoke not one word.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just cut to the chase then Gord\u2026 We\u2019re putting the old band back together\u2026 The Underground man!\u201d blurted Jeffrey.</p><p>Gordon just stood there. His eyes scanning back and forth, up and down. His persnickety manner and expression of judgement, unsettling.</p><p>A long moment followed. And then Gord let out a singing shout\u2026 \u201cDying to take you away\u2026 take you todaaay!\u201d</p><p>And with that, he slammed the door shut, and could be heard marching off to his study. The boys looked at each other. Then, as if the whole reaction by Gordon had been expected, they just turned and slowly started back toward home.</p><p>\u201cI could have told you.\u201d said Stanley. \u201cNot quite right, that one,\u201d said Daryl.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chapter\u00a0Three</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Like Riding a Bicycle</em></h2><p>In the days that followed, the boys reserved a time slot in the dining hall for their first rehearsal in over forty five years. Becky, Debbie, Lorinda and Renee were there, and sat anxiously waiting as the boys set up their gear and began\u2026 a sound check.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear\u2026 \u201cPlease Mr. Postman!\u201d shouted Lorinda while rapidly clapping her hands with nervous excitement.</p><p>\u201cPlay\u2026 \u201cTwist and Shout!\u201d said Debbie.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I want to hear\u2026 \u201cMr. Moonlight!\u201d cried Renee.</p><p>The boys were nervously, purposely, taking a painstakingly long time to prepare. Adjusting the microphones up, then down. Then back up again. Their eyes looked up at the ceiling as they tuned their guitars, then they tuned them again. And again.</p><p>Stan sat at his drums reading a book of the collecting of rare postage stamps. Soon the girls began to talk small amongst themselves, catching up on who is still with us, and who is gone. Having a good time with themselves, they lost tract of the band, and sat in happy chatter, sipping tea.</p><p>\u201cEnough boys, let\u2019s do something then!\u201d said Jeff.</p><p>They huddled together for a quick talk, then walked back to the microphone stands. And, in perfect three part harmony, they started to sing\u2026</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody.\u201d</p><p>The band kicked in, in perfect time.\u00a0\u201cSpot on\u201d with every chord and every guitar lick. The first song played in so many years, and it all fell together like magic.</p><p>\u201cOh my lord.\u201d said Deb.</p><p>\u201cLike riding a bicycle.\u201d said Becky.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t chance that they chose the music of the favorite band of all time. Nor was it chance that they had chosen that song, as it was the first one played for the girls at their graduation dance all those years ago. Appropriate as well, as it described Gordon the old fart who didn\u2019t know what he was missing.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chapter\u00a0Four</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The\u00a0Gig</em></h2><p>It didn\u2019t take very long before the word was out, and the boys were offered a show at \u201cThe Smoke\u2019n Tea Room.\u201d Val was the first to complain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a spot for the youngsters! The Hippety Hoppers!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry.\u201d responded Jeff. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to show them a thing or two about good music, and good fun!\u201d</p><p>The girls were all about it, and scurried off to find just the right things to wear.</p><p>\u201cSmoke and tea, and youngsters is about right!\u201d thought the boys as they set up their gear on stage the following evening, as this night spot sat in a foggy part of the meadow, giving the look of a smoke all around. And the crowd was all sipping it up, as the tea here comes in all colors and flavors.</p><p>A few of these regulars whispered amongst themselves and giggled when they saw the elderly act that was about to perform.</p><p>\u201cPay them no mind boys.\u201d said Beck. \u201cYou just carry on, keep it tight, and remember\u2026 a good song knows no place or time.\u201d</p><p>And then\u2026 the boys stepped up, and approached the microphones. With nervous excitement, Val called out to the crowd\u2026 \u201cHello there\u2026 we\u2019re The New Day Underground! One, two, three, four\u2026 Well she was just seventeen\u2026 you know what I mean\u2026 And I saw, her, staaan-ding there!\u201d</p><p>The boys were right on with their choice of song! The girls were up dancing, clapping, and singing along. And the crowd of youngsters were\u2026 sitting, and smiling, with a glazed look in their eyes as their thumbs fiddled excitedly about\u2026 the face of their mobile phones! They\u2019re toes were tapping along to the beat, but they were transfixed, as if hypnotized by\u00a0the tiny, silly messages that they sent to one another from across the room.</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll be\u2026,\u201d thought Stanley.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026,\u201d thought Daryl.</p><p>\u201cSon of a gun,\u201d\u00a0thought Jeffrey.</p><p>And \u201cGo figure!\u201d grumbled Val.</p><p>They played flawlessly through the set of ten songs, and Jeff finishing it off with\u2026 \u201cTill\u2026 there was yooouuu!\u201d The girls clapped and cheered, and shouted\u2026 \u201cBravo!\u201d</p><p>The young crowd looked up with a smile, sipped their tea, and then, they went right back into thumb twiddling excitement.</p><p>On their way home that night, the girls chatted and gave great compliments as the boys silently took turns pulling the cart with their instruments.</p><p>\u201cIt a new day alright.\u201d said Stan.</p><p>\u201cQuite right.\u201d said Daryl.</p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t get it!\u201d said Val.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d the girls explained. \u201cThe kids liked the music. They\u2019re just all wrapped up in themselves for right now! In a short while, they\u2019ll be a little older and look more at their changing world. They\u2019ll listen back on the music of their Dads and Mums, and come to love it as their own. They\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chapter\u00a0Five</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>All Together Now</em></h2><p>As time carried on, so did the boys. The New Day Underground ended up\u2026underground. Going nowhere\u2026 man. And that\u2019s just the way they liked it!</p><p>Classic cinema, balloon volleyball, a good book by the fire. And, on Friday nights\u2026 a live show by the band in the dining hall. The girls couldn\u2019t be happier as well. They served multicolored tea for all as the boys played their favorite songs. The elderly crowd nodding, toe tapping, dozing off, and bouncing up from time to time, singing along to\u2026\u201cAll Together Now!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Copyright 2016 Jeffrey Duchene</p><p>A,B,C,D\u2026 can I bring my friend to tea?
