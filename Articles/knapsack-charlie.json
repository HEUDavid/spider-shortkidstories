Because of this everyone called\u00a0him Knapsack Charlie. His backpack was a pretty blue backpack with wide straps and shiny\u00a0buckles and it went flip, flop, flip, flop.</p><p>Charlie knew something about his backpack that no one else knew.\u00a0Whatever Charlie found he put in his backpack. He had a feather, gum, acorns, tissue, a\u00a0smooth gray stone, a screw, a piece of paper, string, a broken crayon, and much more.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you save all those silly things?\u201d asked his older brother. \u201cYou\u2019ll never use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe I will,\u201d answered Charlie. Charlie thought to himself I need everything I have in my backpack.</p><p>Flip, flop flip, flop walked Knapsack Charlie.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, must you take that backpack wherever you go?\u201d asked mom.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Charlie \u201cI might need something that\u2019s in my backpack.\u00a0Just the other day my friend needed a red crayon and I had one in my backpack,\u201d answered Charlie.</p><p>Dad said, \u201cIf you always carry that backpack, your shoulders will turn in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walk with my shoulders pushed back,\u201d answered Charlie.\u00a0Charlie smiled. He knew that he had many valuables in his backpack.</p><p>Flip flop, flip, flop walked Knapsack Charlie.</p><p>\u201cOh, look what I found,\u201d said Charlie. He opened his backpack and added a paper clip, a bottle cap, and an empty juice can.</p><p>The following morning Charlie, his brother, and his mother were in the dentist\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d said his brother. \u201cI wish I had something to read.\u201d</p><p>Charlie opened his backpack and pulled out a comic book. \u201cHere, you can read this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you had your backpack,\u201d replied his brother.</p><p>On the ride home, the car went, spurt, spurt, and then it stopped.\u00a0Mother said, \u201cOh, dear, I forgot my cell phone and the car just ran out of gas. I\u2019ll have to call the gas station.\u201d She looked in her purse. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find any change for the phone booth,\u201d she said.</p><p>Charlie peered into backpack, \u201cI have two quarters,\u201d he said to his mother.</p><p>\u201cThank you, said mother. \u201cI\u2019m happy that you brought your backpack with you.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon Charlie was at the tennis court watching his father play tennis. \u2018Fiddlesticks,\u201d exclaimed his dad. \u201cMy sneaker lace just broke.\u201d</p><p>Charlie looked in his backpack and pulled out a shoelace. \u201cI have a brown shoelace. \u201cDo you want it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d replied his dad. \u201cThat backpack of your certainly comes in handy.\u201d</p><p>Flip, flop, flip, flop Knapsack Charlie walked away smiling.</p><p>Charlie had treasures in his backpack and now everyone knew what Charlie knew all the time.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Knapsack-Charlie-photo-opt.jpg'></img>"}
