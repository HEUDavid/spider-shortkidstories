She was not supposed to leave the pasture. But that day she headed straight into the corn fields. Courtney\u2019s family watched her disappear through the tall stalks.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Courtney go in there? She knows better,\u201d the brother calf mooed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she thinking?\u201d mooed the Daddy cow, slowly shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she is looking for adventure,\u201d the older sister cow mooed with a grin.</p><p>It was certain that no one in the family knew why Courtney had wandered off. The family watched the top of the stalks wiggle as Courtney weaved her way through them. No one wanted to go after her. They knew the rules of the farm. Going into the corn fields was defiantly not okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Courtney mooed, looking at the corn stalks.</p><p>She wandered here and there and there and here. Slowly Courtney was becoming lost in the corn field. The smell of the corn, hidden by rough green husks, was making her even hungrier. Courtney\u2019s stomach started making noise. Then the rumble grew louder. Courtney couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She had to eat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe just one piece of corn,\u201d she mooed.</p><p>Courtney took her front hooves, pounced on the stalk of corn, and pulled an ear off. After she finished the first ear of corn she craved more.</p><p>\u201cOne more wouldn\u2019t be so bad,\u201d Courtney mooed.</p><p>Courtney munched on another ear of corn. With only two ears of corn in Courtney\u2019s stomach she wanted more.</p><p>\u201cA couple more ears of corn won\u2019t hurt,\u201d she mooed.</p><p>Finally Courtney started to feel full, but now she had eaten forty-two ears of corn!</p><p>\u201cHow could I have eaten all that corn?\u201d she mooed, looking at her new larger stomach. \u201cMaybe I should lay down for a quick nap.\u201d Courtney laid down between the stalks of corn.</p><p>While she slept the sun grew very hot. Eventually the sun became so hot that it woke Courtney up.</p><p>\u201cI am too full to get up,\u201d she mooed. \u201cAnd my stomach feels funny.\u201d</p><p>Courtney waited a bit, and then used all of her strength to stand up. That is when she heard a POP. Then a POP, POP.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that popping sound?\u201d Courtney mooed.</p><p>POP, POP, POP.</p><p>Over the popping Courtney heard her name.</p><p>\u201cCourtney, come home,\u201d her family mooed from the pasture.</p><p>POP, POP. POP, POP.</p><p>Courtney slowly began to find her way out of the corn field. She weaved back and forth around the corn. She was scared about the popping sound coming from her stomach. Courtney made it out of the corn field and over to her family in the pasture. They all gathered around.</p><p>POP. POP, POP. POP.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m popping. Do you hear that?\u201d Courtney asked her sister.</p><p>POP, POP, POP, POP.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she mooed with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d mooed brother cow.</p><p>POP POP. POP POP, POP POP.</p><p>\u201cI ate the corn from the stalks,\u201d Courtney mooed.</p><p>All of the cows hung their heads in shame of Courtney\u2019s actions. Courtney knew that she never should have wandered off.</p><p>POP. POP. POP, POP. POP.</p><p>\u201cThe corn must be popping into popcorn because of the heat,\u201d Daddy cow mooed.</p><p>Courtney\u2019s stomach went POP, POP, POP, the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>In the evening the sun set and it grew dark and cool.</p><p>\u201cI think the popping has stopped,\u201d Courtney mooed.</p><p>Late that night, when the stars started to twinkle, Courtney\u2019s stomach started to feel better and she began to fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cThat is the last time I ever wander off where I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Courtney mooed quietly, just before she started to snore.</p>"}
