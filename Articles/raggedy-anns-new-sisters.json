They were playing that Freddy was in bathing and that he wanted to be covered with the clean white sand, just as the other bathers did. And when they had covered Freddy they took their little pails and shovels and went farther down the beach to play and forgot all about Freddy.</p><p>\u201cNow when it came time for us to go home, Virginia and Doris remembered Freddy and ran down to get him, but the tide had come in and Freddy was \u2018way out under the water and they could not find him. Virginia and Doris were very sad and they talked of Freddy all the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too bad they forgot Freddy,\u201d said Marcella.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed it was!\u201d the new friend replied as he took Raggedy Ann up and made her dance on Marcella\u2019s knee. \u201cBut it turned out all right after all, for do you know what happened to Freddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what did happen to him?\u201d Marcella asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, first of all, when Freddy was covered with the sand, he enjoyed it immensely. And he did not mind it so much when the tide came up over him, for he felt Virginia and Doris would return and get him.</p><p>\u201cBut presently Freddy felt the sand above him move as if someone was digging him out. Soon his head was uncovered and he could look right up through the pretty green water, and what do you think was happening? The Tide Fairies were uncovering Freddy!</p><p>\u201cWhen he was completely uncovered, the Tide Fairies swam with Freddy \u2018way out to the Undertow Fairies. The Undertow Fairies took Freddy and swam with him \u2018way out to the Roller Fairies. The Roller Fairies carried Freddy up to the surface and tossed him up to the Spray Fairies who carried him to the Wind Fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Wind Fairies?\u201d Marcella asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cThe Wind Fairies carried Freddy right to our garden and there Virginia and Doris found him, none the worse for his wonderful adventure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreddy must have enjoyed it and your little girls must have been very glad to get Freddy back again!\u201d said Marcella. \u201cRaggedy Ann went up in the air on the tail of a kite one day and fell and was lost, so now I am very careful with her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you let me take Raggedy Ann for a few days?\u201d asked the new friend.</p><p>Marcella was silent. She liked the stranger friend, but she did not wish to lose Raggedy Ann.</p><p>\u201cI will promise to take very good care of her and return her to you in a week. Will you let her go with me, Marcella?\u201d</p><p>Marcella finally agreed and when the stranger friend left, he placed Raggedy Ann in his grip.</p><p>\u201cIt is lonely without Raggedy Ann!\u201d said the dollies each night.</p><p>\u201cWe miss her happy painted smile and her cheery ways!\u201d they said.</p><p>And so the week dragged by\u2026.</p><p>But, my! What a chatter there was in the nursery the first night after Raggedy Ann returned. All the dolls were so anxious to hug Raggedy Ann they could scarcely wait until Marcella had left them alone.</p><p>When they had squeezed Raggedy Ann almost out of shape and she had smoothed out her yarn hair, patted her apron out and felt her shoe-button eyes to see if they were still there, she said, \u201cWell, what have you been doing? Tell me all the news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh we have just had the usual tea parties and games!\u201d said the tin soldier. \u201cTell us about yourself, Raggedy dear, we have missed you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Tell us where you have been and what you have done, Raggedy!\u201d all the dolls cried.</p><p>But Raggedy Ann just then noticed that one of the penny dolls had a hand missing.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d she asked as she picked up the doll.</p><p>\u201cI fell off the table and lit upon the tin soldier last night when we were playing. But don\u2019t mind a little thing like that, Raggedy Ann,\u201d replied the penny doll. \u201cTell us of yourself! Have you had a nice time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not tell a thing until your hand is mended!\u201d Raggedy Ann said.</p><p>So the Indian ran and brought a bottle of glue. \u201cWhere\u2019s the hand?\u201d Raggedy asked.</p><p>\u201cIn my pocket,\u201d the penny doll answered.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s13c.jpg'></img><p>When Raggedy Ann had glued the penny doll\u2019s hand in place and wrapped a rag around it to hold it until the glue dried, she said, \u201cWhen I tell you of this wonderful adventure, I know you will all feel very happy. It has made me almost burst my stitches with joy.\u201d</p><p>The dolls all sat upon the floor around Raggedy Ann, the tin soldier with his arm over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, first when I left,\u201d said Raggedy Ann, \u201cI was placed in the Stranger Friend\u2019s grip. It was rather stuffy in there, but I did not mind it; in fact I believe I must have fallen asleep, for when I awakened I saw the Stranger Friend\u2019s hand reaching into the grip. Then he lifted me from the grip and danced me upon his knee. \u2018What do you think of her?\u2019 he asked to three other men sitting nearby.</p><p>\u201cI was so interested in looking out of the window I did not pay any attention to what they said, for we were on a train and the scenery was just flying by! Then I was put back in the grip.</p><p>\u201cWhen next I was taken from the grip I was in a large, clean, light room and there were many, many girls all dressed in white aprons.</p><p>\u201cThe stranger friend showed me to another man and to the girls who took off my clothes, cut my seams and took out my cotton. And what do you think! They found my lovely candy heart had not melted at all as I thought. Then they laid me on a table and marked all around my outside edges with a pencil on clean white cloth, and then the girls re-stuffed me and dressed me.</p><p>\u201cI stayed in the clean big light room for two or three days and nights and watched my Sisters grow from pieces of cloth into rag dolls just like myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour SISTERS!\u201d the dolls all exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cWhat do you mean, Raggedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d said Raggedy Ann, \u201cthat the Stranger Friend had borrowed me from Marcella so that he could have patterns made from me. And before I left the big clean white room there where hundreds of rag dolls so like me you would not have been able to tell us apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have told you by your happy smile!\u201d cried the French dolly.</p><p>\u201cBut all of my sister dolls have smiles just like mine!\u201d replied Raggedy Ann.</p><p>\u201cAnd shoe-button eyes?\u201d the dolls all asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, shoe-button eyes!\u201d Raggedy Ann replied.</p><p>\u201cI would tell you from the others by your dress, Raggedy Ann,\u201d said the French doll, \u201cYour dress is fifty years old! I could tell you by that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my new sister rag dolls have dresses just like mine, for the Stranger Friend had cloth made especially for them exactly like mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how we could tell you from the other rag dolls, even if you all look exactly alike!\u201d said the Indian doll, who had been thinking for a long time.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d asked Raggedy Ann with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBy feeling your candy heart! If the doll has a candy heart then it is you, Raggedy Ann!\u201d</p><p>Raggedy Ann laughed, \u201cI am so glad you all love me as you do, but I am sure you would not be able to tell me from my new sisters, except that I am more worn, for each new rag doll has a candy heart, and on it is written, \u2018I love you\u2018 just as is written on my own candy heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are hundreds and hundreds of the new rag dolls?\u201d asked the little penny dolls.</p><p>\u201cHundreds and hundreds of them, all named Raggedy Ann,\u201d replied Raggedy.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d said the penny dolls, \u201cwe are indeed happy and proud for you! For wherever one of the new Raggedy Ann dolls goes there will go with it the love and happiness that you give to others.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s13d.jpg'></img>"}
