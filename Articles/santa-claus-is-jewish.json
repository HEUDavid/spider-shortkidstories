My Mommy and Daddy have the SAME amount of money YOUR Mommies and Daddies have\u201d, Sandra answered. \u201cWe just don\u2019t BELIEVE in Christmas like you; that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d they all asked. \u201cEVERYBODY believes in Christmas. You\u2019re just being silly, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI AM NOT!\u201d Sandra protested in a loud voice.\u201dMommy and Daddy and Me are JEWISH!\u00a0 We have our OWN kind of Christmas. It\u2019s called \u2018CHANUKAH\u2019 and we have lights and presents, too. So don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m being silly.\u00a0 My holiday is JUST as nice and special to me as yours is to you\u201d, stated Sandra proudly.</p><p>\u201cWell, YOUR holiday doesn\u2019t have a SANTA CLAUS, does it?,\u201d Kim asked with a little sly grin.</p><p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t, Kim\u201d, said Sandra, \u201cbut the teacher said that SANTA CLAUS is a friend to EVERYBODY; he\u2019s EVERY RELIGION AND EVERY COLOR. He doesn\u2019t just give presents to good girls and boys who only celebrate\u00a0Christmas.\u201d</p><p>The girls all thought about what Sandra had said, looked at each other and then looked at Sandra, and, in one voice said\u201d Well, if that\u2019s true, we guess you could say that SANTA CLAUS IS JEWISH!\u201d</p><p>Then they all sat down together and continued playing their games; friends once again\u2026..</p>"}
