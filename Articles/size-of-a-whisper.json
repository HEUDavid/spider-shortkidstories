Maybe even the size of a whisper.</p><p>\u201cMom, how small is a whisper?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA whisper?\u201d she asked. \u201cI imagine very small, Mark. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia is tiny. I want to be tiny again too, and a whisper might be a good tiny size to be,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOlivia is a baby, but you are a big boy. Why do you want to be tiny again?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember being tiny. I think being tiny again would be fun. If I was tiny again then you could carry me around just like Olivia,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI could tell you stories of when you were tiny,\u201d my mom suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, that will not work,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to be tiny in a whisper sort of way.\u201d</p><p>I headed off to my room and closed the door. With my door closed Mom couldn\u2019t bother me in my transformation to become a whisper. I felt excited about being tiny again and did a little dance.</p><p>After my dance, I grabbed my photo album and flashlight off my bookcase. I walked over and closed my blinds so that it would be very dark. Then I sat in the middle of my bed. I opened the photo album full of my baby pictures and shined my flashlight on them. After I had the pictures in my memory, I switched off the flashlight so I could concentrate. Nothing happened. I needed help. I shone my flashlight around my room until I found what I needed. My secret weapon!</p><p>Placing my football helmet on my head, I once again sat on my bed. I pointed the flashlight on the pictures quickly and then shut it off. I closed my eyes and thought really hard. I was still having trouble, so I placed both my hands firmly on my helmet. My hands will help keep my powers from escaping. I whispered, \u201cMark, baby Mark. Tiny baby Mark.\u201d</p><p>Then I stopped whispering and thought again, tiny like a whisper. Then slowly I started to feel like a whisper, which is really quite small, the size of lint from a belly button. The same tiny as in the baby pictures of me. I had tiny fingers, toes, arms, legs, and even my belly button was tiny too. I had done it! I had become the size of a whisper. I jumped off my bed, tore off my helmet, and open my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cMom, Mom,\u201d I called running down the hall.</p><p>\u201cYes Mark, what is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI did it. I became the size of a whisper!\u201d I said, falling into her lap.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I added. \u201cWhat happened? I\u2019m not tiny anymore. It didn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Mark. Tell me how tiny a whisper was,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cThe size of belly button lint,\u201d I proudly said.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, that is small,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I like you as a big boy instead,\u201d she added, giving me a squeeze, \u201cbecause big boys get to help me make cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I am a big boy, and not the size of a whisper,\u201d I told my mom.</p>"}
