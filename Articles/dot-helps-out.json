The old red tractor coughed and spluttered as smoke poured out of its engine.</p><p>\u2018Mrs MacTattie! Mrs MacTattie! Call the mechanic!\u2019 Farmer MacTattie shouted jumping out the tractor in fright.</p><p>When the mechanic arrived Dot, MacStout and all the MacTatties watched as he looked at the tractor.</p><p>They watched as he poked and prodded. They watched as he scratched his head. They listened when he said, \u2018It will cost \u00a3100 to fix.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u00a3100!\u2019 Farmer MacTattie, Mrs MacTattie and the little MacTatties shook their heads.</p><p>\u2018We don\u2019t have \u00a3100. What will we do? The field needs ploughing and the potatoes planting.\u2019 Farmer\u00a0 MacTattie thought for a moment then declared, \u2018I\u2019ve got it!\u2019 so loudly he made Mrs MacTattie and the little MacTatties jump \u2018MacStout can pull the plough!\u2019.</p><p>Dot, Mrs MacTattie and the little MacTatties watched as MacStout pulled the plough.\u00a0 He pulled the plough a few steps tripped over a stone and slipped.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019, Farmer MacTattie, Mrs MacTattie and the little MacTatties asked as they ran to MacStout.</p><p>\u2018Neigh! Neigh!\u2019 MacStout neighed in pain as they helped him to his feet.</p><p>Farmer MacTattie looked at Mrs MacTattie, \u2018MacStout can\u2019t pull the plough. What will we do?\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Moo,\u2019 Dot said standing beside the plough.</p><p>Farmer MacTattie laughed, \u2018You\u2019re a cow, you can\u2019t pull a plough!\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Moo!\u2019</p><p>Mrs MacTattie and the little MacTatties laughed, \u2018You\u2019re a cow, you can\u2019t pull a plough!\u2019.</p><p>\u2018MOOOOO!!\u2019 Dot replied stubbornly.</p><p>\u2018Well if you insist, I\u2019ll give you a go.\u2019 laughed Farmer MacTattie as he put the reins around\u00a0 Dot\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dot strained and pulled. The plough didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Dot! You can do it!\u2019,all the MacTatties shouted.</p><p>Dot strained and pulled. The plough still didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u2018Breath deeply then put your back into it,\u2019 MacStout neighed, encouragingly.</p><p>Dot took a deep breath and pulled. The plough moved.</p><p>\u2018Well done, Dot!\u2019 All the MacTatties cheered.</p><p>\u2018Well done!\u2019 neighed MacStout.</p><p>They were all so excited that they hadn\u2019t noticed, the man by their side until he spoke.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen a cow pull a plough!\u2019, he said taking photographs and asking questions.</p><p>The next day a picture of Dot pulling the plough was all over the front page of the newspapers. Then the farmer from next door and the farmer from over the hill followed by cars and coaches full of people came to look at the cow who had pulled a plough.</p><p>The little MacTatties who had been watching all the comings and goings from their bedroom window, suddenly appeared in the field with a box on which they had painted, \u2018A penny a photo\u2019\u00a0 and placed it by the fence.</p><p>The MacTatties got their \u00a3100 and more. The old red tractor was fixed, the potatoes were planted and Dot\u00a0 got her own plough. MacStout got new shoes.</p>"}
