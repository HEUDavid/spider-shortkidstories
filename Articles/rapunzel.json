At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.</p><p>One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful plant called rampion (also called rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.</p><p>This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, \u201cWhat ails you, dear wife?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she replied, \u201cif I can\u2019t get some of the rampion which is in the garden behind our house, to eat, I shall die.\u201d</p><p>The man, who loved her, thought, \u201cSooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost you what it will.\u201d In the twilight of evening, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much relish. She, however, liked it so much, so very much, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.</p><p>In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. \u201cHow can you dare,\u201d said she with angry look, \u201cto descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d answered he, \u201clet mercy take the place of justice. I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.\u201d</p><p>Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, \u201cIf the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\u201d The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the little one came to them, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.</p><p>Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath this, and cried,</p><p>\u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel,</p><p>Let down your hair to me.\u201d</p><p>Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braids, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty yards down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.</p><p>After a year or two, it came to pass that the King\u2019s son rode through the forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The King\u2019s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,</p><p>\u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel,</p><p>Let down your hair.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/139.png'></img><p>Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. \u201cIf that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune,\u201d said he, and the next day, when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried.</p><p>\u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel,</p><p>Let down your hair.\u201d</p><p>Immediately the hair fell down, and the King\u2019s son climbed up.</p><p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes had never yet seen came to her; but the King\u2019s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for a husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, \u201cHe will love me more than Dame Gothel, the old enchantress does;\u201d and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI will willingly go away with you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a length of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will come down, and you will take me on your horse.\u201d They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.</p><p>The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her, \u201cTell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King\u2019s son\u2014he is with me in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! you wicked child,\u201d cried the enchantress, \u201cwhat do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!\u201d</p><p>In her anger she clutched Rapunzel\u2019s beautiful tresses of hair, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snip, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so mean that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert, where she left her to live in great grief and misery.</p><p>On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the enchantress in the evening fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the hook of the window, and when the King\u2019s son came and cried,</p><p>\u201cRapunzel, Rapunzel,</p><p>Let down your hair,\u201d</p><p>she let the hair down. The King\u2019s son climbed up, but he did not find his dearest Rapunzel above, but the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d she cried mockingly. \u201cYou would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her more.\u201d</p><p>The King\u2019s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leaped down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.</p><p>Like this he roamed about I in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes, and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. They first went back to her parents, who were overjoyed to see her. Then he led her to his kingdom, where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.</p>"}
