"<p>Santa was feeling tired.\u00a0He was sitting on a park bench feeding bread to the pigeons when the thought struck him hard.\u00a0\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to be Santa anymore; he\u2019d been too long at it!\u00a0\u00a0 All that climbing down chimneys and \u2018ho ho ho\u2019-ing was beginning to wear him down.\u00a0\u00a0 It was time to quit; time to hand over Rudolph\u2019s reins to somebody else.\u00a0\u00a0 What people didn\u2019t seem to realise in the world was the Santa was more than just a part of Christmas, like holly with red berries, or rich Christmas pudding, or golden turkey or Christmas crackers, or a choir singing \u2018The holly and the ivy\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 The truth was (and only a very few people knew it!) that none of these things would exist without Santa.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa was the centre core of it all.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa was like the boss of a gigantic world-wide company \u2013 a company that distilled the water so that it made the grass grow in a special way at Christmas or arranged the sunlight that shone through the window on Christmas morning while presents were being opened.\u00a0\u00a0 Without him it would curl up and die and December would be as drab as January.\u00a0\u00a0 No magic sparkle from a Christmas bauble, no secret tasting of a piece of pudding on Christmas Eve, no unbelievable excitement in the heart of a child.\u00a0\u00a0 To put it simply, No Santa \u2013 No Christmas.</p><p>Santa\u2019s heart was heavy, but he knew he had to go, to give the job to someone else, but who?\u00a0\u00a0 That was the question.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa thought long and hard and deeply about this question.\u00a0\u00a0 When people were driving to work in the morning Santa was thinking and when Santa was thinking, little pieces of Christmas glitter would fall from the sky.</p><p>Santa liked to take long walks in the country and it was on one of these walks that he got his idea.\u00a0\u00a0 Christmas, which Santa held in his heart \u2026 a heart which he held fully open like an umbrella covering the whole world every December 25th \u2026 Christmas, Santa decided could only be given to someone who would continue to cherish and safeguard it as he had done all his life.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa didn\u2019t know of any human on the whole planet earth that he could entrust Christmas to, so Santa decided that he would give Christmas to a creature from the animal world.\u00a0\u00a0 But which animal?\u00a0\u00a0 There were birds and bats and foxes and lizards and frogs and toads and cats and dogs and a list that went on and on.\u00a0\u00a0 In the week before Christmas when the spirit of Christmas was starting to fall down on the earth like an invisible snow, Santa took a long walk through a forest watching the animals.\u00a0\u00a0 In the end Santa settled finally and definitely on one animal and it was a bird \u2013 the robin red-breast.</p><p>Three days before Christmas when the snow came and Santa was walking by a fast flowing river, a robin came to Santa and landed on his forefinger and Santa knew this was the one.\u00a0\u00a0 This was the robin he would give Christmas to.\u00a0\u00a0 So Santa closed his eyes and touched the tiny head of the robin.\u00a0\u00a0 As Santa let go of Christmas it poured into the robin \u2013 everything that Christmas ever was or would be from the magic in the child\u2019s eye to the sound of Christmas carols in a church covered with snow flowed into the tiny robin.\u00a0\u00a0 These things all had an ingredient without which they would be nothing and it was Santa, the heart of Christmas, it was all things Christmas and Santa gave it all to a red-breasted robin.</p><p>The result was that Santa was no longer Santa, he was simply Nick, and the red-breasted robin was a very special robin.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin knew this immediately, and he knew that Christmas that year depended now on him.\u00a0\u00a0 But the robin knew it was an impossible task for him to fulfil the role of Santa.\u00a0\u00a0 How could he \u2013 a tiny bird \u2013 get presents to every child in the world on Christmas Eve just as Santa had done since Christmas began?\u00a0\u00a0 The robin didn\u2019t know how it was possible to do this but he loved the feeling of having all of Christmas inside him and as he bounced off the rooftops and set a burst of whistling into the snowy air with two days to go to Christmas he, like Santa, had an idea.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin knew that Christmas would have to be given to a person and since Santa was tired and didn\u2019t want the job anymore the robin would have to find someone else.</p><p>In the meantime the robin knew he would have to fly around the world scattering Christmas everywhere, which he did, and all the time as he was doing this the robin wondered \u2018who would be the new Santa?\u2019</p><p>A speckled pigeon went scurrying for a piece of bread, keeping one watchful eye on the raggedly old man who threw the bread to him \u2013 it was Nick and he had his head bent low as he sat on the park bench.\u00a0\u00a0 A torn newspaper lay on the ground and from Nick\u2019s eyes tears were falling, splashing onto it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Oh no\u2019 he said in a quiet whisper.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Oh no\u2019 he repeated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018What have I done?\u00a0\u00a0 Santa is no more\u2026 Santa is no more\u2026\u2019 he said the words aloud and they seemed to echo off the rooftops and up into the sky.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018This isn\u2019t right\u2019 he clenched his teeth and wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his old coat.\u00a0\u00a0 He realised he\u2019d made a mistake.\u00a0\u00a0 He was Santa \u2013 he couldn\u2019t just give up being Santa!\u00a0\u00a0 There was only one thing for it.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019d have to find that robin.\u00a0\u00a0 He started to run through the park, calling \u2018Robin red-breast, robin red-breast\u2026 wherever you are, come back to me, come back to me\u2026\u2019</p><p>Meanwhile, in another park, the robin red-breast was watching another old man.\u00a0\u00a0 The man looked to the robin like a good prospective Santa \u2013 he had a rosy-cheeked face which was covered with a beautiful white beard \u2013 so he decided this man was the right one.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin flew down from a tree and landed on the man\u2019s shoulder, but the man was asleep and didn\u2019t even notice.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin lifted its tiny head and let out a long shrill whistle while he let go of the spirit of Christmas from himself and let it pour down into the old man.</p><p>The man woke with a startled look on his face.\u00a0\u00a0 He knew something had happened to him but he didn\u2019t know what it was.\u00a0\u00a0 He looked around him half expecting to see a wizard or something because he felt absolutely filled with magic.\u00a0\u00a0 He went running through the park \u2013 half-crazed, with every inch of his body bursting with the spirit of Christmas.\u00a0\u00a0 The flicker of his eyebrow was carol singers singing \u2018In Excelsis Deo\u2019 in a boy\u2019s voice so sweet it would melt your heart.\u00a0\u00a0 The stamping of his feet was Santa\u2019s reindeers treading the air on a snowy December 25th.\u00a0\u00a0 His breath was the breath of Santa which if bottled could be sold for a million dollars to a rich man on a hot summer\u2019s day.</p><p>Back in the other park Nick was still running and calling for the robin red-breast to come back to him.\u00a0\u00a0 The entrances to the two parks met the same road and as the two men reached the gates they caught sight of one another.\u00a0\u00a0 Trance-like now, they walked towards each other and met face to face.\u00a0\u00a0 Nick was the first to speak. \u2018Have you seen him\u2026 have you see him?\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019 asked the second man.</p><p>\u2018The robin, the robin, the robin red-breast\u2026\u2019 said Nick.</p><p>The other man shook his head \u2018No\u2026\u2019</p><p>The two men stood looking at each other.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 said Nick.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Jack\u2019 said the other man.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018I\u2019m nobody special\u2026 but something\u2019s happened to me\u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is that happened to me, but something did \u2026\u2019</p><p>Nick stared at him for a long time \u2018I know who you are\u2019 he said eventually.</p><p>\u2018Who am I?\u2019 asked Jack.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re Santa\u2019 replied Nick.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Santa you say.\u00a0\u00a0 Hah \u2026 I\u2019m not Santa!\u00a0\u00a0 I may look like Santa \u2013 but then so do you \u2026\u2019 said Jack.</p><p>\u2018I was Santa\u2026\u2019 said Nick sadly.</p><p>\u2018What happened, tell me\u2019 said Jack.</p><p>They sat down together on a park bench and Nick told Jack his story about what it had been like to be Santa and how he had foolishly grown tired of it and given it all away.\u00a0\u00a0 Jack looked at his hands.\u00a0\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0\u00a0 His hands seemed to glisten with a Christmas glow.\u00a0\u00a0 Behind the two men was a holly bush with red berries on it and on one of the branches of the bush sat a robin.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin flew over and landed on Jack\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0 The robin cocked his head and looked at Jack.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jack suddenly understood everything so he reached out his hand and let Christmas go.\u00a0\u00a0 It flowed like a silver river into the robin, through him and back into Nick, the real Santa.\u00a0\u00a0 Jack didn\u2019t want to be Santa, he wouldn\u2019t know how to be Santa, but he liked the fact that he had been Santa for a little while and when it all left him a small fire still burned inside him and he was a very happy man.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa was also happy as he\u2019d been given a second chance.\u00a0\u00a0 Tears of joy were flowing down Santa\u2019s face as he realised what a terrible mistake it had been to give up being Santa and how glad he was to be back in the job he loved!</p><p>It was Christmas Eve night and the snow was falling from the sky.\u00a0 In a small park Santa\u2019s sleigh was slowing descending from the sky and it landed on the snow encrusted grass.\u00a0\u00a0 Santa let go of the reins and got out of his sleigh.\u00a0\u00a0 He walked over to a park bench.\u00a0\u00a0 Jack was sitting there.</p><p>\u2018Hello, Jack\u2019 said Santa.</p><p>\u2018Santa\u2019 Jack said, smiling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018You\u2019ve come back!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jack, my friend\u2019 said Santa, putting his hand on the man\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018You gave me back all my joy and saved me from a life of misery \u2026 will you do something else for me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 asked Jack.</p><p>\u2018Come with me\u2019 said Santa.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Come with me into the air above the world and help me bring Christmas to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0 What do you say?\u2019</p><p>Jack was delighted to be invited on such a wonderful trip and so he climbed aboard Santa\u2019s sleigh and they flew off into the sky.</p><p>That year all the children got extra special presents, because Santa was saved by Jack.\u00a0\u00a0 They both travelled to a billion homes around the world on Christmas Eve and in every single one of those homes Santa left a special note to the children saying how glad he was to be Santa and that he would never tire of bringing the spirit of Christmas and, of course, Christmas presents to them.</p><p>Santa was saved and so the heart of Christmas still beats.</p>"}
