We are all part of the frog family and come from various ponds and waterways around the world.</p><p>As we go on our musical journey you will learn all about the instruments we play and the people we meet. Watch out for the words printed in  red as at the end of our story you will find the meaning of all the  red words and enjoy discovering what they mean in musical terms, and there will also be a quiz so look carefully\u2026</p><p>Now you know who we are we can tell you our story but first turn the page and meet the band\u2026</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Band1.gif'></img><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Band2.gif'></img><p>Somehow FROGBEAT managed to come together\u00a0because of our great love of music. It just seemed to happen.</p><p>We started out as a  trio\u00a0(Andy, Oggie and myself) just playing for fun at  Percussion Pond, our only audience being  Gilbert Guppie  Sullivan  Seagull,  Crotchet  Crab and  Quaver  Duck.</p><p>Suddenly our music became a very important part of our lives and the more we played the better we became.</p><p>Soon our fame spread throughout the animal kingdom so it wasn\u2019t surprising when other members of the frog family came along and joined us at  Percussion pond.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/POND.jpg'></img><p>Andy greeted each new member by saying with his\u00a0usual happy smile \u201cWelcome to our world of music. Oggie, Ronnie and myself are pleased to hear that you want to join our band.\u201d</p><p>And so three became eight and FROGBEAT was born.</p><p>It took many hours of practice for us all to blend and\u00a0become happy in each other\u2019s company but at last we had\u00a0the right sound. Now we needed to do something with it\u00a0by making ourselves known to all lovers of music.</p><p>It was our friend  Cadenza the Carthorse who lived in\u00a0 Brass Barn close to our pond who came up with the\u00a0brilliant idea of touring the countryside to sell our music.</p><p>In a very excited voice he said \u201cMy Master,  Major\u00a0Minor, is a very kind gentleman, and has offered you\u00a0the use of my good self and his cart to take your music\u00a0to the people.\u201d</p><p>This was too good a chance to miss. We quickly packed\u00a0everything we felt we would need.</p><p>Gillie made a very brave speech as we sadly said\u00a0\u201cgoodbye\u201d to our friends  Gilbert Guppie,  Sullivan\u00a0 Seagull,  Crotchet Crab, and  Quaver the Duck \u201cWe will\u00a0never forget you. When we are famous we will come\u00a0back to see you all,\u201d he said.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/CADENZA.jpg'></img><p>As we slowly moved away we could hear all our friends\u00a0singing a good luck song in  harmony.</p><p>Then FROGBEAT hit the road not knowing what we would bump into on our musical journey.</p><p>The thrill of the mysteries that could lie ahead of us, because of our need to play music, gave us a great sense of adventure.</p><p>It was quite tiny inside the cart but we each took it in\u00a0turns to sit up at the front with  Cadenza and help to guide him along the right road.</p><p>Singing together, with Andy strumming his guitar, we made our way along the country lanes, which of course  Cadenza knew quite well.</p><p>We must have travelled quite a few miles before we came upon a village green. A number of people were gathered around a large tall and beautiful tree known as  Woodwind Willow They all appeared to be gazing up at its branches.</p><p>Oggie had fallen asleep on the journey but suddenly\u00a0opened his eyes and said, \u201cWhy is everyone looking up at the sky? Let\u2019s find out what the problem is and see if we can help.\u201d</p><p>A kitten had somehow climbed up to the highest branch and now seemed to be having difficulty getting back down. So much noise was being made that the poor\u00a0little kitten looked very frightened. No way was he going to move down the tree whilst the people were\u00a0shouting at him!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/CATTREE.jpg'></img><p>Then FROGBEAT came to the rescue.</p><p>\u201cCome on chaps grab your music and let\u2019s help this poor frightened cat.\u00a0\u00a0 Spread yourselves out around the bottom of the tree\u201d said Bernie holding on tight to his trumpet.</p><p>\u201cShould we play a fast jazzy number? asked Andy.</p><p>\u201cNo we need to relax that kitten so he\u2019ll come down!\u201d replied Bernie.</p><p>As soon as we were ready we began to play a very soothing  melody . When\u00a0 our music filled the air the people suddenly stopped calling out to the cat. Slowly they rocked back and forth in time to the  beat\u00a0 of the music.The humming noise they made to the tune we were playing seemed to calm the cat.</p><p>Very slowly he came down from the tree and trotted off in the direction of his house saying to himself</p><p>\u201cLoved the music but whatever was all the fuss about.\u00a0\u00a0 I would have made it to the bottom by myself after that silly dog left\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dog?\u201d asked  Cadenza.</p><p>But the cat had already trotted off too fast to hear him.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/CRESCENDO2.jpg'></img><p>We felt really happy because FROGBEAT had been able to assist in rescuing the cat from the branches of the tree.</p><p>After carefully putting our musical instruments away\u00a0we\u00a0 made our way back into  Cadenza\u2019s cart.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were just getting ready to move on again when a large car drew up alongside the village green.</p><p>The car door opened and out stepped Mayor  Minim,\u00a0 looking very grand in his mayoral robe.</p><p>He came towards our band saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad you are still here.\u00a0\u00a0 My wife heard your music and I have come to ask you a favour. I really do need your help. Tonight the annual Mayor\u2019s Ball is taking place at  Orchestra Town Hall and the band that I had booked for the dancing is unable to appear.\u00a0\u00a0 Would you please help me by taking their place?\u201d</p><p>Well what an honour that was!!</p><p>Tilly even fainted with excitement!</p><p>The Mayor went on to say \u201cYou see my wife has had a new ball gown especially made to fit her and she will be very sad if the ball is cancelled and she is unable to\u00a0 wear it.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/MAYOR.jpg'></img><p>\u201cWe would be glad to help Mr.\u00a0 Mayor!\u201d said Eddie.</p><p>\u201cYes! It would be our pleasure but we\u2019ve never played at a Ball before.\u00a0 What should we wear?\u201d added Freddie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my tailor could easily make up some tuxedos and a dress for Tilly very quickly\u201d replied the Mayor smiling happily.</p><p>\u201cDid someone say something about a new dress\u2026\u201d asked Tilly, slowly coming around from her faint.</p><p>So off we went to the tailors to get our new outfits.</p><p>The ball was fantastic!</p><p>How well we played that night.</p><p>The large ballroom was beautifully decorated for the occasion. In the centre of the high ceiling an enormous light, which looked very much like a sparkling glass spider, shone on the dancers as they glided across the floor in time to our music. It was magical.</p><p>We would never forget Mayor Minum\u2019s Ball. This exciting and colourful event had given us our first chance to shine and prove ourselves to be a good band.</p><p>Tilly had been delighted with her new dress and our tuxedos looked very smart.</p><p>The Mayor had even brought along his dog  Diminuendo to listen to FROGBEAT.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/BALL-copy.jpg'></img><p>It was towards the end of the evening that a well-dressed gentleman who had been sitting with the Mayor approached us with an amazing offer.</p><p>Smiling happily he said \u201c Hello FROGBEAT, my name is Simon  Semibreve.\u00a0The cat you rescued\u00a0 from the tree this afternoon belonged to my daughter  Duet.</p><p>She would have been so upset to think that  Crescendo cat might have spent the night in a tree, between you and me it\u2019s  Diminuendo\u2019s fault. That dog is always terrorizing poor old  Crescendo. \u00a0\u00a0 So one good turn deserves another. \u00a0Listening to your music tonight I would like you to come along to my studio, the world famous  Strings Studio. (Tilly nearly fainted again!)\u00a0\u00a0 I think your music is great and my  sound engineer NiNi Rabbit has been recording your music all evening for a live album.</p><p>We were so excited we could hardly sleep that night.</p><p>Fancy the great Simon\u00a0 Semibreve being interested in FROGBEAT.</p><p> Cadenza\u00a0 Carthorse, however, felt it was time he returned home to  Brass Barn with his master\u2019s cart.</p><p>\u201cI am beginning to feel homesick\u201d, he said with a tear in his eye. \u201cMy master will be needing me now. You can all come back with me if you like but I\u2019ll understand if you want to stay here and record your music. It\u2019s a fine thing you have been offered and I\u2019m very proud\u00a0 to have been a part of your success story.\u201d</p><p>We could see a great future for FROGBEAT\u2019s\u00a0music as well as a chance for us to travel around the country so we decided to stay. We felt this was an opportunity\u00a0 to fulfil our dream with the help of our new friends Simon Semibreve and NiNi Rabbit the sound engineer.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/STUDIO.jpg'></img><p>As we said our goodbyes and watched Cadenza begin to make his way home alone, Freddie tearfully said</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sad that Cadenza is leaving us\u2026\u201d</p><p>Gillie replied, \u201cWe will never forget him or Percussion Pond. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll go back there one day to see him and all our friends. Just think of the many adventures that lie ahead for FROGBEAT in the meantime! We will have so much to tell them all when we do return.\u201d</p><p>All we knew at this moment was that the hard work we had put into forming our band was about to give us a new way of life. How glad we were that all our practicing had given us this reward.</p><p>At this exciting point in our story we said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to Cadenza Carthorse and our old life at Percussion pond and \u201chello\u201d to the rest of the big wide world.</p><p>THE END of our story but only the beginning of a new life for FROGBEAT\u2026</p>"}
