But when it came to teasing, for some unknown reason, at age seven I seemed to be the favorite target. The three oldest\u2013\u2013Eric, Lara, and Adam\u2013\u2013were experts at it. They seemed to know exactly what to do to get under my skin.</p><p>And speaking of skin, that just happened to be their target one day\u2013\u2013the skin on my scalp, that is.</p><p>\u201cHey, Evelyn, has your head been itching lately?\u201d Adam asked in that falsely innocent tone I always hated.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm. Just wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it be itching?\u201d I was getting suspicious. Adam had that smug look on his face that always meant trouble\u2013\u2013trouble for me.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of dandruff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve heard of dandruff. What of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe you\u2019ve got some. Want me to check your head to make sure?\u201d</p><p>Mortified at the thought that I had enough dandruff to be noticed by somebody else, I let down my guard and meekly nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down so I can see better\u2026.ummm, this looks bad. Lara, come tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it looks bad to me, too. Eric, come help us decide.\u201d</p><p>I cringed as the three of them poked around in my hair. Finally, Eric said, \u201cWell, the best way to tell for sure is for you to lean over the coffee table, Evelyn. Scratch your head and we\u2019ll see if any dandruff comes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d agreed the other two.</p><p>Trustingly, I followed their directions. I knelt down beside the table, leaned over, and started scratching. To my horror, white stuff began pouring onto the table!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/dandruff-illustration-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cOhhhh noooo!\u201d I wailed. Scrambling to my feet, I raced into the kitchen, grabbed my mom around the waist, and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is the matter, Evelyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom! It\u2019s terrible! I\u2019ve got the most horrible dandruff! What am I gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she soothed. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ve got horrible dandruff?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hand and tugged her into the living room. Shame-faced, I pointed to the coffee table.</p><p>She glanced at it for less than half a second and then noticed Eric, Lara, and Adam trying to disappear down the hall. \u201cHold on, you three!\u201d</p><p>They turned back as Lara tried unsuccessfully to hide the saltbox under her sweater. Their bottled-up laughter spilled over as they confessed, \u201cOh, Mom, we know we shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve done it, but it was so funny!\u201d</p><p>Mom shook her head and let out a long-suffering sigh. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you kids find something else to do with all your wonderful creativity?\u201d Turning to me, she gave me a warm hug and an understanding smile, saying, \u201cTry not to let them bother you, Evelyn.\u201d</p><p>And I did try. Really, I did. But every time after that, whenever I salted my food at the table and glanced up to see Adam grinning at me, I couldn\u2019t help wondering what prank the three of them were planning to spring on me next!</p>"}
