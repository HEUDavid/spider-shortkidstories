One of the little gnomes put his finger to his lips for silence and peeped cautiously around the largest stone. There he saw a crab and a lobster sitting upon a bunch of sea-weed in the sunshine.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/063.jpg'></img><p>The other little gnome tip-toed up and joined his brother and when they had listened a while they winked at each other and quietly walked back to the beach. After whispering together a moment one of the little gnomes ran up the beach and over a sand dune.</p><p>The other gnome again crept up behind the large stone and listened to the lobster and the crab.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said the crab, \u201cI agree with you, Mr. Lobster! While our coats are just a plain green they are still quite beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! You speak the truth, Friend Crab,\u201d the lobster replied, \u201cGreen is a lovely color and I am very glad that we are not purple!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very glad that we are green, too.\u201d the crab said, \u201cJust suppose we were colored blue! I know I should not be able to stand it! Would you, Friend Lobster?\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo indeed!\u201d the lobster cried, \u201cNor would I care to change to any other color, would you, Friend Crab!\u201d \u201cIt is nice to be satisfied! Isn\u2019t it, Friend Lobster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Especially when we are as satisfied as we are!\u201d The lobster answered.</p><p>The little gnome listening behind the large stone winked at himself and smiled. He knew the lobster and the crab would give anything if they were of a different color, for he could tell by their conversation they were dissatisfied with their green coats.</p><p>Soon the other little gnome appeared over the sand dunes carrying a large kettle, and when he got to a spot on the beach where the crab and the lobster could see and hear him he began shouting in a sing-song manner: \u201cOld clothes changed to new! Old clothes changed to new! Old clothes changed to new!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/064.jpg'></img><p>\u201cPooh!\u201d said the lobster. \u201cWho is foolish enough to wish to change their natural coats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm!\u201d said the crab as he sidled towards the beach. \u201cLet\u2019s go over and talk with him, anyway, and ask him if anyone ever changes the color of their clothes. Not that I wish to change my lovely green coat, you understand, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be interesting to hear about it, anyway!\u201d the lobster replied, as he crawled after the crab.</p><p>The little gnome with the large kettle sat upon the beach and pretended he did not see the crab and lobster, but continued crying: \u201cOld coats changed to new! Green ones changed to red! Old coat changed to new! Old coats changed to new!\u201d</p><p>When the crab and the lobster came up quite near the little gnome pulled a number of pieces of colored cloth from his pocket and placed them upon the sand.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty!\u201d said the crab.</p><p>\u201cVery lovely!\u201d said the lobster.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish your coats changed in color?\u201d asked the little gnome.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, thank you!\u201d the two hypocrites said. \u201cWe were just looking around a bit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am glad to have your company,\u201d said the little gnome as he took a piece of scarlet cloth and laid it over the lobster\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like that?\u201d he asked of the crab.</p><p>\u201cIt looks fine!\u201d said the crab. \u201cTry it on me!\u201d</p><p>The little gnome placed the scarlet piece of cloth over the crab\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d he asked the lobster.</p><p>\u201cDid I look that well in that color?\u201d asked the lobster by way of reply.</p><p>\u201cI think both of you will look far better if you let me change you to scarlet. It\u2019s in far better taste, too!\u201d the little gnome added, pinching himself to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cShall we change?\u201d the crab asked the lobster and the lobster asked the crab.</p><p>\u201cYou will find the color a great deal warmer,\u201d said the little gnome. \u201cGreen is decidedly cold, you know!\u201d</p><p>So the little gnome gathered an armful of drift-wood and built a fire. Then he dipped the kettle into the sea and placed the crab and the lobster in the kettle of water and put the lid on.</p><p>\u201cBe sure and make us a brilliant scarlet!\u201d cried the lobster and the crab, as the little gnome placed the kettle over the fire. An hour later the two little gnomes lay upon their backs upon the sand and yawned contentedly, their little round stomachs almost bursting their belts. Near them was the upturned kettle, and scattered all about them on the sand were lovely pieces of scarlet lobster and crab shells.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d one little gnome said drowsily, \u201chow one sometimes will become dissatisfied with the way he was made by Mother Nature and try to improve upon her work! It usually leads to misfortune.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/065.jpg'></img><p>\u201cYes, that is true,\u201d the other little gnome replied, \u201cWe should be satisfied and contented just as we are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I for one am satisfied!\u201d the little gnome said, stroking his fat stomach.</p><p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d his brother laughed.</p>"}
