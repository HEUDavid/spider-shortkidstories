He walked up in front of the two new dolls and looked them sternly in the eyes, but he could think of nothing to say so he pulled at his yarn mustache.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s8b.jpg'></img><p>Marcella had only received the two new dolls that morning. They had come in the morning mail and were presents from an aunt.</p><p>Marcella had named the two new dolls Annabel-Lee and Thomas, after her aunt and uncle.</p><p>Annabel-Lee and Thomas were beautiful dolls and must have cost heaps and heaps of shiny pennies, for both were handsomely dressed and had real hair!</p><p>Annabel\u2019s hair was of a lovely shade of auburn and Thomas\u2019 was golden yellow.</p><p>Annabel was dressed in soft, lace-covered silk and upon her head she wore a beautiful hat with long silk ribbons tied in a neat bow-knot beneath her dimpled chin.</p><p>Thomas was dressed in an Oliver Twist suit of dark velvet with a lace collar. Both he and Annabel wore lovely black slippers and short stockings.</p><p>They were sitting upon two of the little red doll chairs where Marcella had placed them and where they could see the other dolls.</p><p>When Uncle Clem walked in front of them and pulled his mustache they laughed outright. \u201cTee-Hee-Hee!\u201d they snickered, \u201cHe has holes in his knees!\u201d</p><p>Quite true. Uncle Clem was made of worsted and the moths had eaten his knees and part of his kiltie. He had a kiltie, you see, for Uncle Clem was a Scotch doll.</p><p>Uncle Clem shook, but he felt so hurt he could think of nothing to say.</p><p>He walked over and sat down beside Raggedy Ann and brushed her yarn hair away from her shoe-button eye.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s8c.jpg'></img><p>The tin soldier went over and sat beside them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mind what they say, Raggedy!\u201d he said, \u201cThey do not know you as we do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t care to know her!\u201d said Annabel-Lee as she primped her dress, \u201cShe looks like a scarecrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Soldier must have been made with a can opener!\u201d laughed Thomas.</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourselves!\u201d said the French dolly, as she stood before Annabel and Thomas, \u201cYou will make all of us sorry that you have joined our family if you continue to poke fun at us and look down upon us. We are all happy here together and share in each others\u2019 adventures and happiness.\u201d</p><p>Now, that night Marcella did not undress the two new dolls, for she had no nighties for them, so she let them sit up in the two little red doll chairs so they would not muss their clothes. \u201cI will make nighties for you tomorrow!\u201d she said as she kissed them good night. Then she went over and gave Raggedy Ann a good night hug. \u201cTake good care of all my children, Raggedy!\u201d she said as she went out.</p><p>Annabel and Thomas whispered together, \u201cPerhaps we have been too hasty in our judgment!\u201d said Annabel-Lee. \u201cThis Raggedy Ann seems to be a favorite with the mistress and with all the dolls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be a reason!\u201d replied Thomas, \u201cI am beginning to feel sorry that we spoke of her looks. One really cannot help one\u2019s looks after all.\u201d</p><p>Now, Annabel-Lee and Thomas were very tired after their long journey and soon they fell asleep and forgot all about the other dolls.</p><p>When they were sound asleep, Raggedy Ann slipped quietly from her bed and awakened the tin soldier and Uncle Clem and the three tiptoed to the two beautiful new dolls.</p><p>They lifted them gently so as not to awaken them and carried them to Raggedy Ann\u2019s bed.</p><p>Raggedy Ann tucked them in snugly and lay down upon the hard floor.</p><p>The tin soldier and Uncle Clem both tried to coax Raggedy Ann into accepting their bed (they slept together), but Raggedy Ann would not hear of it.</p><p>\u201cI am stuffed with nice soft cotton and the hard floor does not bother me at all!\u201d said Raggedy.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s8d.jpg'></img><p>At daybreak the next morning Annabel and Thomas awakened to find themselves in Raggedy Ann\u2019s bed and as they raised up and looked at each other each knew how ashamed the other felt, for they knew Raggedy Ann had generously given them her bed.</p><p>There Raggedy Ann lay; all sprawled out upon the hard floor, her rag arms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.</p><p>\u201cHow good and honest she looks!\u201d said Annabel. \u201cIt must be her shoe-button eyes!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s8e.jpg'></img><p>\u201cHow nicely her yarn hair falls in loops over her face!\u201d exclaimed Thomas, \u201cI did not notice how pleasant her face looked last night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others seem to love her ever and ever so much!\u201d mused Annabel. \u201cIt must be because she is so kind.\u201d</p><p>Both new dolls were silent for a while, thinking deeply.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Thomas finally asked.</p><p>\u201cVery much ashamed of myself!\u201d answered Annabel, \u201cAnd you, Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Raggedy Ann awakens, I shall tell her just how much ashamed I am of myself and if she can, I want her to forgive me!\u201d Thomas said.</p><p>\u201cThe more I look at her, the better I like her!\u201d said Annabel.</p><p>\u201cI am going to kiss her!\u201d said Thomas.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll awaken her if you do!\u201d said Annabel.</p><p>But Thomas climbed out of bed and kissed Raggedy Ann on her painted cheek and smoothed her yarn hair from her rag forehead.</p><p>And Annabel-Lee climbed out of bed, too, and kissed Raggedy Ann.</p><p>Then Thomas and Annabel-Lee gently carried Raggedy Ann and put her in her own bed and tenderly tucked her in, and then took their seats in the two little red chairs.</p><p>After a while Annabel said softly to Thomas, \u201cI feel ever and ever so much better and happier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d Thomas replied. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole lot of sunshine coming into a dark room, and I shall always try to keep it there!\u201d</p><p>Fido had one fuzzy white ear sticking up over the edge of his basket and he gave his tail a few thumps against his pillow.</p><p>Raggedy Ann lay quietly in bed where Thomas and Annabel had tucked her. And as she smiled at the ceiling, her candy heart (with \u201cI LOVE YOU\u201d written on it) thrilled with contentment, for, as you have probably guessed, Raggedy Ann had not been asleep at all!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s8f.jpg'></img>"}
