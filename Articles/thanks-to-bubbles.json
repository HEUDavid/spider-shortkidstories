Its name was \u201cFUNTIME\u201d. Jamie Lynne and her parents went for lunch at\u00a0the place, and they liked what they ate and saw: \u201cFUNTIME\u201d had a GAMES ROOM with all kinds of games and plenty of good food. But the BEST thing about it, according to Jamie Lynne,\u00a0was \u201cBUBBLES THE CLOWN.\u201d \u201cBUBBLES\u201d performed many fun tricks, and made the most BEAUTIFUL balloon animals and flowers.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad,\u201d Jamie Lynne said, \u201cTHIS is where\u00a0I want my birthday party to be. I LOVE BUBBLES THE CLOWN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like this place, too, Jamie Lynne. Okay, we\u2019ll tell the \u201cFUNTIME\u201d people that we want your birthday party here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh THANK you, Mom and Dad. I can\u2019t wait until my friends come here for my birthday,\u201d\u00a0Jamie said to them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to LOVE BUBBLES THE CLOWN too.\u201d</p><p>Jamie went home and mailed out her party invitations. Then she crossed the days off on her wall calendar. She couldn\u2019t WAIT for her special day.</p><p>Well, the days went by quickly, and, before she knew it, it was 2 days before her party. Jamie Lynne was SO EXCITED talking about the party to her friends that she didn\u2019t see the rock\u00a0on the sidewalk ahead of her. Jamie Lynne tripped over the rock and fell hard on her ankle.\u00a0She let out a SCREAM when she fell, and her friends ran to find the school principal for help.\u00a0Mr. Sheldon, the principal, ran over to her, and called her parents and then called for an ambulance.</p><p>Jamie Lynne\u2019s parents were at the hospital as the ambulance arrived. Jamie Lynne was taken to the emergency room, and before long, she was resting in a hospital bed. While her ankle was NOT broken, it WAS severely sprained. The doctor told Jamie Lynne and her parents that she had to rest in bed at home, and keep her foot up on pillows. He said that she could not go ANYWHERE for\u00a0about one week. \u201cBut I\u2019m having my birthday party at \u201cFUNTIME\u201d in 2 days. My FRIENDS will all\u00a0be there, and BUBBLES THE CLOWN will be there, too!\u201d Jamie Lynne cried.</p><p>The doctor looked at\u00a0Jamie Lynne and held her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a VERY LUCKY girl, Jamie Lynne. You COULD have broken your ankle BADLY, but it\u2019s just a bad sprain. If you rest up, you can be back at school and with your friends in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut MOM, my PARTY..\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jamie Lynne\u201d, her mother said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out. Don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s just what happened: Jamie Lynne\u2019s parents cancelled the party at \u201cFUNTIME\u201d,\u00a0and told Jamie Lynne\u2019s friends to come to her house for the party.\u00a0The house was decorated with streamers, confetti and balloons of every color.\u00a0Her parents let Jamie Lynne choose what kind of food and cake she wanted for her party.\u00a0Jamie Lynne and her friends were very happy with everything they saw and ate there.\u00a0Then came the SURPRISE her parents had arranged for her: The doorbell rang, and\u00a0who was there?? It was \u201cBUBBLES THE CLOWN!\u201d</p><p>Jamie Lynne let out a SCREAM, but THIS time it was a scream of happiness.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom and Dad, I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE that \u201cBUBBLES THE CLOWN\u201d is at my party!\u00a0That\u2019s AWESOME!! Thank you SOOOO much!!\u201d Jamie Lynne yelled to her parents. She was VERY happy.</p><p>\u201cBUBBLES THE CLOWN\u201d did all the tricks she did at \u201cFUNTIME\u201d. Then she opened\u00a0a big suitcase and took out her balloons and made the most BEAUTIFUL balloon animals\u00a0and flowers that Jamie Lynne and her friends had ever seen!</p><p>\u201cBUBBLES\u201d then made a BIRTHDAY CROWN for Jamie Lynne. It was made of \u00a0gold balloons and decorated with shiny gold sprinkles. Jamie Lynne LOVED it. She gave\u00a0\u201cBUBBLES THE CLOWN\u201d a great big hug to thank her for everything she did.</p><p>Then the time came for \u201cBUBBLES\u201d to leave, and for all of Jamie Lynne\u2019s friends\u00a0to go home.</p><p>\u201cJamie Lynne, THIS was the COOLEST party EVER! WOW, \u201cBUBBLES THE\u00a0CLOWN\u201d came to YOUR HOUSE for your BIRTHDAY. That\u2019s AWESOME!!! Bye now.See you Monday in school.\u201d</p><p>And so, Jamie Lynne\u2019s birthday party was over.\u00a0But thanks to \u201cBUBBLES\u201d, and her parents, Jamie Lynne had the BEST BIRTHDAY\u00a0she ever had!</p>"}
