As night settles in, creatures lurk in the dark shadows. I can\u2019t see them, but I know they\u2019re there. I can hear them snarling, panting. They\u2019re watching me, waiting to hurt me once I\u2019m asleep. I cry out to scare them away.</p><p>There\u2019s something by my side, brushing against my arm. Ow! It bit me! Now a dazzling bright light. I\u2019m blind! I can\u2019t see anything! Calm, familiar voices. My eyes are better, and the pain is easing. I sense my parents by my bedside. \u201cI know, Mom. There really are no monsters. I\u2019m sorry I disturbed you again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be right here when you need us.\u201d Soothing embraces and murmured words of love. I settle back onto the comfortable pillow. I try to sleep. To forget about the monsters.</p><p>In the dimness, there is a big white house. White and pink, like peppermint candy canes. The trees are white and pink. And the street and lampposts. Wait a minute. This can\u2019t be. I know, I must be dreaming. Dad says dreams are the mind\u2019s way of sorting out memories. New memories and old, pleasant and sorrowful. Sounds and visions of the past that blur into one another, without any apparent logic. But why candy canes? I don\u2019t even like them. There was a peppermint candy with my dinner. Did I eat it? I enjoy chocolate much better. Let\u2019s see, maybe I can change that house to\u2026 Yes! It\u2019s made of chocolate, as is the road. And the trees are now milk chocolate with M&M\u2019s for leaves. This reminds me of that story about a man who owned a chocolate factory. Some kids won a contest and they were welcomed inside. Chocolate everywhere! Candy flowers in fields of bright green grass, like the field next to my brother\u2019s high school. Bruce doesn\u2019t live at home any more. He recently went far away to college, but he\u2019s already on his way back to visit. When he was here, he was the best soccer player in town. He could kick the ball so hard it went up to the sky, as high as the airplane we took when we went to say farewell to my grandmother. Grandma looked so peaceful in her favorite dress. Dad told me I\u2019d see Grandma again someday, but not for a very, very long time. I hope so. I miss her.</p><p>The airplane again, or maybe another one, slicing through the night. The meal was rather awful, but it did have candy for dessert. Was it peppermint? Mom and Dad are watching the in-flight movie. They won\u2019t let me wear headphones, but I can hear some of it as I peek at the screen. It has a lot of hitting, shooting, cursing, blood. The people in the film are brutal. They are like the monsters in my room. I hate them. I\u2019m relieved when it is finally over and the lights come on. Everything is bright again. The wicked people have disappeared. Did they ever truly exist? I doze on Mom\u2019s shoulder. All I hear is the rumbling of the engines. And Mom\u2019s heartbeat. Lub-dub. Lub-dub.</p><p>The people in the movie. The monsters in my room. The airplane engines. The snarling. The fighting. The pain. Mom\u2019s heartbeat. What is reality? What is illusion?</p><p>The light. The light makes everything better. It chases the fictional evils back into my imagination, leaving behind only the truth. When there is light, the darkness, the pain, and my fears, are gone.</p><p>Grandma. Bruce. Lub-dub. The light. Dad. Mom. Lub-dub, Lub-dub, Lub-</p>"}
