They were Robin and Jack. They knew that Ralph was a super hero named as Hero Man. He once defeated the scientist cats, when they made a bomb blast. Now, Ralph was waiting for his second mission.</p><p>\u201cCome on guys, let\u2019s get in,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cIt\u2019s cloudy.\u201d</p><p>Just as they were about go in, Robin screamed \u201cYIKES, WHAT\u2019S THAT?\u201d</p><p>A large U.F.O appeared from nowhere. \u201cIt is a U.F.O!\u201d screamed Jack.</p><p>It was large as ten houses. It landed on hill. A man with a hat covered with stars, a cloak, and a wand came flying with something magnetic on his feet. Then he landed near Ralph, Robin and Jack. The wizard\u2019s dress said Cambria World. He was the Wizard of the Cambria World and he was staring at them.</p><h2>\u00a0Chapter 2 \u2013 The Wizard in Trouble</h2><p>The friends were stunned for a moment. Then Ralph spoke. \u201cI am Ralph and these are my friends Robin and Jack. Who are you and why you are here?\u201d</p><p>The wizard said in a deep voice. \u201cSo you are Hero Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and again I ask, who are you?\u201d Ralph said.</p><p>The wizard said \u201cI\u2019m the wizard of the Cambria world and I need your help\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ralph asked.</p><p>\u201cAn evil witch named Spakey has been killing the people of our country,\u201d answered the wizard. \u201cHe has very powerful magic. We can\u2019t stop him. So I came here looking for Hero Man and I finally found you. Will you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I will come. But what is the Cambria world?\u201d Ralph asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an enchanted world\u201d the wizard said. \u201cNow come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cCan my friends come too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the wizard said.</p><p>\u201cCome on guys, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Ralph.</p><p>He quickly changed himself into Hero Man.</p><h2>\u00a0 Chapter 3 \u2013 The Cambria World</h2><p>As they entered the U.F.O., the wizard spoke: \u201cActually this not the U.F.O, it is the Cambria Spaceship. \u201c</p><p>\u201cOh ok,\u201d said Hero Man, \u201csorry to say that\u201d then the spaceship began to rise and then took off. Within minutes it landed in the Cambria World. It was chilly and breezy.</p><p>\u201cIt is so beautiful,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWhat is this? It is midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah \u2026.. What? It\u2019s midnight!\u201d screamed the wizard suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Hero Man.</p><p>\u201cIt is midnight and Spakey can get more power and he can defeat anybody at this time,\u201d said the wizard.</p><p>\u201cBut not me,\u201d said Hero Man.</p><p>Suddenly, something swooped down and laughed manically at them. It was Spakey</p><h2>\u00a0Chapter 4 \u2013 Battle Time!</h2><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d the wizard said.</p><p>\u201cHa ha ha ha,\u201d laughed Spakey manically.</p><p>\u201cBattle with me, Spakey!\u201d Hero Man shouted.</p><p>Spakey laughed. \u201cBattle with me! Ha ho check this out\u2026.. Ha!\u201d</p><p>Hero man was shooting his Fire Blast. They both started the battle. Hero Man was fighting. In the middle of the fight, Hero Man said, \u201cGo to Spakey\u2019s hiding place and find the valuables he stole from the castle\u201d</p><p>Robin said, \u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>Robin and Jack started to run and the wizard flew with them. Then, Hero Man used the Ice Blast and Spakey was on freeze. After sometime he became a normal human being, when Hero Man saw his friends and the Wizard returned.</p><p>He saw a gold medallion in the Wizard\u2019s hand. Hero Man saw that it was glowing brightly.</p><p>\u201cThis is sacred Strength Medallion,\u201d said the wizard. You may come to my castle for\u2026\u2026 a surprise.\u201d</p><h2>\u00a0Chapter 5- We Are Heroes</h2><p>Then, the Wizard led Hero Man and his friends. When they went inside they were shocked, the castle was filled with dance, fun, and food.</p><p>\u201cPlease come to my throne,\u201d said the wizard, then he called to everybody and they were absolutely still.</p><p>\u201cIn honor of Hero Man, Robin and Jack, I give a freedom for everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYipee!\u201d cheered the crowd.</p><p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d \u00a0asked Hero Man.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d replied the wizard.</p><p>In an instant Hero Man and his friends had disappeared and Hero Man was Ralph again. He yawned and said \u201cBye, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Ralph,\u201d Robin and Jack said together. \u201cWe will help you in your next mission.\u201d</p><p>And it had been a long day for Hero Man and his friends.</p>"}
