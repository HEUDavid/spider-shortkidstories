They had no horses, nor food, only bronze metal swords to match their armor, and purple cloaks that covered their backside. The knights were: young Crown Prince Donteaus, his cousin Duke Tatianus, and his uncle Archduke Aelfric. They had sided with their countrymen and joined a war against invaders. But a separation from their company caused the three noble knights to journey deep into the misty forest\u2014they were lost\u2014with no direction of camp.</p><p>\u201cWe might never reach the camp in time for tomorrow morning\u2019s attack,\u201d said Aelfric. \u201cWe will, all we have to do is keep our heads up and search for the company,\u201d said Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cThe sun is setting,\u201d warned Tatianus. Time became scant\u2014so they quickly stopped and used their capes as handkerchiefs\u2014to wipe their tears from the chilled air. From a slight sparkle of the sun Donteaus noticed an emerged hill in front of them. He ran fast to the hill leaving Aelfric and Tatianus in bewilderment (so they followed behind him).</p><p>\u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed Aelfric once he reached Donteaus. They viewed a tall tree that was further ahead\u037e the tree was the tallest in the forest.</p><p>\u201cI wonder the height of this tree?\u201d questioned Tatianus.</p><p>\u201cWe might get a look at the entire forest at the top of the tree. And look there\u2019s even a tower, do you see?\u201d asked Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aelfric confirmed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk to it,\u201d suggested Donteaus. He began to walk towards the tree with Aelfric and Tatianus.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard \u2018The Tale of the Wooden Tower\u2019?\u201d asked Aelfric. \u201cNo,\u201d answered Donteaus and Tatianus.</p><p>\u201cThe tale is about a young dressmaker, from the kingdom, who ventured into the forest to look for a giant sequoia tree. The young girl needed wood from this tree because it was said to be the finest piece of wood and could create the best sewing needles a tailor should have. It\u2019s said that the dressmaker traveled so deep into the forest that by the time she found the tree, she didn\u2019t know how to get back to the kingdom. But the tree had a wooden tower built at the top. And the young dressmaker sits in the tower waiting for a young prince to rescue her and help her back into the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe this is the tree?\u201d asked Donteaus. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tale,\u201d answered Aelfric.</p><p>As they approached the tree, the sunset had made the sky turn pink. They stared at the tree and noticed that there was a very old rope ladder leading to the tower on the bark.</p><p>\u201cWho will go?\u201d asked Tatianus (who was scared of the task).</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Donteaus bravely volunteered. \u201cI will climb up to the wooden tower and look for any signs of the company or the camp.\u201d He fiercely grabbed the rope of the ladder as if he was reaching for his sword.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens don\u2019t fall down,\u201d warned Aelfric.</p><p>\u201cWorry not Uncle,\u201d said Donteaus. He began climbing, leaving Aelfric and Tatianus watching him nervously. Donteaus climbed and climbed\u037e with every step he took he wasn\u2019t afraid. When he reached the top of the ladder he looked back at the view before stepping into the wooden tower. The view was very lighthearted for the young knight who had seen all but war.</p><p>He saw the landscape of the entire forest and even the beautiful pink sky. Then, he climbed inside of the wooden tower and perceived the smell. It smelled of very old perry. He looked around and the tower appeared occupied with hangings of dresses on the walls, and a figure laid covered in deer fur on a straw bed.</p><p>Who could it have been? A knight sent to stand guard and watch the forest? Donteaus had no clue. So he walked slowly over to the bed. He pulled the deer fur over and there slept a feeble old woman. She had felt the coldness of the air and awakened. Her grey eyes matched the color of the satin dress she wore. And when she saw Donteaus she panicked.</p><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d she screamed out. She got out of the bed and moved around the tower frantically. Donteaus tried to calm her down but she wouldn\u2019t stop. Until, she backed into a nail that held the ladder.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d screamed Donteaus. He ran past her to reach for the ladder. But it was too late, the ladder was gone. He looked down at the view, frightened that he may never reach the ground again.</p><p>\u201cSorry boy, I thought you were someone else,\u201d the old woman apologized. \u201cIt\u2019s gone! The ladder is gone. And now we\u2019re stuck up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been stuck up here for a long time boy,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re the dressmaker?\u201d asked Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to rescue me and show me the way back to the kingdom. Who are you boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just climb down and walk into the direction you felt the kingdom was in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, boy I didn\u2019t know where I was going. I had walked for miles, in circles and still did not run into the kingdom. Then, I found this tree. The one tree that I needed wood from to make these needles,\u201d said the dressmaker. She pulled out three carved wooden needles, from her pocket. \u201cThese wonderful needles were worth it. They create precision for even the most toughest fabric. I\u2019ve created all these dresses you see hanging before you made from the tower\u2019s curtains, rugs, and tapestry.\u201d But Donteaus seemed less interested about the the dresses she created with her wooden needles.</p><p>\u201cHow was any of that in this tower? What is this place? How did you survive?\u201d questioned Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cThis was an abandoned watch tower created shortly before I arrived, during the time of your father\u2019s father. It was created for knights who were watchers of the forest. I survived by the stock abundance of food and perry that was kept in this watchtower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA watchtower,\u201d repeated Donteaus. He rapidly walked back over to the ledge and viewed the forest one more time. At that time, the sky had turned purple giving out some light. Donteaus looked beyond the trees and saw smoke further northeast, with light reflecting off of red and purple tents.</p><p>\u201cThe camp! They are not far from here!\u201d cheered Donteaus. \u201cAelfric! Tatianus!\u201d he shouted looking down for them, but heard nothing in return.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you shouting boy?\u201d asked the dressmaker disturbed by his loudness.</p><p>\u201cMy kin is waiting for me below. We\u2019ve been searching for camp because our company left us behind. If you and I can make it down, then I will take you with us to the camp then back into the kingdom,\u201d suggested Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cBut how will we get down?\u201d she asked (Donteaus asked himself that same question). He looked around at her creations and analyzed the fine needlework.</p><p>\u201cWe will climb down with your dresses,\u201d answered Donteaus. With the help of the dressmaker the two of them took down all the dresses and tied them all together (all twenty seven dresses). He then tied the dresses to the nail that once held the ladder.</p><p>\u201cHold onto my back real tight,\u201d demanded Donteaus.</p><p>\u201cI surely will,\u201d said the dressmaker. Donteaus climbed down the tall sequoia tree with the dressmaker on his back. He stared at the wooden tower the entire way down. The tower may have had some misfortune for the knight but also contentment. He not only found the way to camp but also rescued the dressmaker from the wooden tower. When the dressmaker\u2019s feet touched the ground she followed the three knights to camp, and there Donteaus took a horse and the two of them rode to the kingdom\u2014where a celebration for the returned dressmaker paused the war for two days.</p>"}
