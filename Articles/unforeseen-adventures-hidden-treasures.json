Mum was pretty upset and big brother, well, he ignored me as always.</p><p>I was mad!</p><p>And I was done with Dads and swore never to have one again, but after I had just turned seven, Mum met my Stepdad and this whole story began.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I hated his place. It was so boring. It was summer when we moved into Stepdad\u2019s house. Mum said it was bigger and we had an extra playroom, which was fun. Now we could build castles or houses without having to put them away \u2013 ever, but all my friends lived close to our old home. We had a garden now; all pretty with flowers for Stepdad loves gardening, but we couldn\u2019t run around or climb trees. There weren\u2019t any kids either, at least none I could see in these high-walled houses.</p><p>Bored, I roamed the house. The playroom was BORING! My brother was at soccer camp somewhere \u2013 what a stupid game. I kicked his actions figures off their fortress, payment for leaving me. I went to look for Mum and found her at her desk working.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and play in your room,\u201d she rubbed my head absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cBoring,\u201d I said and put on my best pouting face so she would feel sorry for me. Didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cGo into the garden. It\u2019s nice out,\u201d she said, kissed my head and pushed me towards the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too loud,\u201d I sulked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes \u2013 the construction next door,\u201d she stared hard at the computer. \u201cRun on. They\u2019ll finish soon.\u201d</p><p>I dragged my feet over the floor, hands deep in my pockets.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget,\u201d Mum said over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t go to Chris\u2019 study!\u201d</p><p>A smile formed on my face. The perfect place to go exploring.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d she called after me.</p><p>\u201cHeard you!\u201d I shouted back as loud as I could already tiptoeing up the stairs. Stepfather\u2019s study was in the attic \u2013 one large room with huge tilted windows in the roof, all way too high for me to look out. The room was stuffed with old smelly books, ant-hic \u2013 what ever that means \u2013 furniture and huge treasure trunks. Chris and Mum took us up there once before Mum declared it off limits.</p><p>\u201cYou seeeeeeee,\u201d Mum had said in her special voice. \u201cThere is nothing interesting here,\u201d she took my hand.</p><p>\u201cPuh, these old books stink,\u201d my brother said and went back to his computer game.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Chris added trying to be nice. I ignored him.</p><p>Mum raised her eyebrows. That always meant trouble. \u201cYou won\u2019t be as generous when your First Editions will be used to built castles or serve as doll tables with pop spilled over them.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou got a point, there.\u201d And kissed her! Yuk! Right in front of me, I tucked her hand quickly and pulled her down the stairs.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Well, I admit I tried a couple of times to sneak up there, but moms have super senses or something for she always caught me. Finally one night before my bedtime story, she told me the truth about the room.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Lizzy.\u201d Mum tugged me in. \u201cThe study is very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a room with ole books,\u201d I said, but Mum looked very serious.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like that,\u201d Mum said. \u201cBut the room is one big Time Machine.\u201d</p><p>Never heard of such a thing. \u201cA What?\u201d</p><p>Mum looked me in the eyes. \u201cIt transports you in time. To the future or the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoauh!\u201d I wanted to try that. \u201cTo see dinosaurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but once the door closes behind you, the study will spin through time. You won\u2019t feel a thing since the inside wouldn\u2019t move, but if you step out of the door\u2026\u201d She paused and I held my breath excitedly. \u201cYou won\u2019t be on the stairs, but maybe on a mountain with a Triceratops or out in space with spaceships zooming around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d I clapped my hands.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mum whispered, \u201cbut how will you get back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her stories, love.\u201d Stepdad\u2019s voice came from the door and Mum flashed him an odd look. He leaned in the doorframe and blew me a Good Night kiss since I would squirm every time he tried to hug or kiss me. He was NOT my dad after all.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I reached the landing. It was stuffy and dust flew lazily in the air. I hesitated in front of the dark oak door. I looked over my shoulder holding my breath. No, Mum was still in front of the computer; I could hear her fingers flying over the keyboard. I took a big breath and pushed the handle down. The door swung open without a sound and I slipped through.</p><p>The room lay in silence. Not even a fly buzzed in the hot afternoon air and I crept into the middle where a heavy table stood half-hidden by a dark-green cover with golden toddles.</p><p>It was gloomy in here \u2013 where was the sun? Through the windows I could only see a part of the sky. Dark clouds were chasing each other. Expectantly, I studied the room and waited \u2013 nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cHah, just one of Mum\u2019s stories!\u201d</p><p>She writes them for a living. I knew it. I laughed aloud and strolled around the table when a draft brushed my neck. I twisted my head. The door moved very slowly as if elves pushed it and then it slammed shut. The heavy wood rattled in the frame and then silence smothered the room. I held my breath, but nothing happened. So I took all my courage and walked towards the door. My knees wobbled so much; I thought I never make it.</p><p>CRASH! The room shook. My heart jumped to my ears as I sprinted back to the table. A bright light flashed past one of the windows and a roar thundered. The whole room swayed now and I crawled under the table as quickly as I could.</p><p>The Time Machine had activated!</p><p>I closed my eyes and clasped my hands over my ears, but the tumult would not stop. I cowered on the ground wishing I had listened to Mum. Then as quickly as it started it stopped. An eerie silence filled the room and I dared to look out from under the heavy tablecloth. The room lay in twilight, but looked the same. I edged out and listened.</p><p>Where was I? Better when was I?</p><p>I took a step towards the door when a horrible screech rebounded through the room. My heart stopped. Then silence. I edged closer to the door. Another scream filled the air, followed by a sound of gigantic teeth munching on bones. Dinosaurs, shot through my head. Eating one another.</p><p>BOOM! The room shook. BOOM, BOOM. The window glass vibrated in its frame and I looked up. A huge shadow swished over me. I screamed and darted under the table.</p><p>Lights flashed followed by a low grumble as I rolled into a ball as tight as I could.</p><p>The door flew open. \u201cLizzy, are you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d I whispered. No, he was back in my time.</p><p>A shadow fell over me. \u201cDon\u2019t eat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, why would I do that?\u201d Chris said and I peeked out from under my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou came to save me,\u201d I launched forward and nearly knocked him over. His big arms engulfed me as I hid my face in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI was so scared. The dinosaurs were out there. To get me. I couldn\u2019t get back. Never see Mum again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d he rubbed my back.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I sniffled.</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cRemote control.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. \u201cYou brought the Time Machine back with a remote?\u201d</p><p>He said with a smile. \u201cCouldn\u2019t leave you as dino food, could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYour Mum was so worried and sad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I set the dials and jumped in the room as soon as it stopped. Luckily, you are a smart girl and didn\u2019t leave the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe T- Rex was just outside, smashing his gigantic tail against the wall to get in and eat me!\u201d I blinked away the tears.</p><p>Chris nodded gravely. \u201cIf you had left the room, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to save you, since the Time Machine never lands twice in the same spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lost forever,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>He winked. \u201cBut you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He scooped me up into his arms and carried me downstairs to Mum.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Now, of course, I know there are no Time Machines and the dinosaur was only the crane next door. I know that now being so much older. I\u2019m nine! But my Stepdad is still my secret hero. I don\u2019t make life any easier for him, but he stayed and I love him for that.</p>"}
