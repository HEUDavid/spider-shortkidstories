They talked of nothing but Santa Claus.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wish you could see him?\u201d they said over and over.</p><p>One night, just before Christmas, Mother tucked them in bed and left them to go to sleep. But Jack wiggled, Margaret wriggled. At last they both sat up in bed.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Margaret whispered, \u201care you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI can\u2019t go to sleep. Margaret, don\u2019t you wish you could see Santa Claus? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>They both listened, and they heard a little tap, tap on the window. They looked, and there, right in the window, they saw a funny little Brownie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that I heard you say? You want to see Santa Claus? Well, I am one of his Brownies. I am on my way back to Santa Claus Land. I\u2019ll take you with me if you want to go.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Margaret scrambled from their beds.</p><p>\u201cCome on, show us the way!\u201d they cried in great excitement.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said the Brownie. \u201cNo one must know the way to Santa Claus Land. Kindly wait a moment.\u201d</p><p>Then the Brownie took something soft and thick and dark, and tied it around Jack\u2019s eyes. Next he took something soft and thick and dark, and tied it around Margaret\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow many fingers before you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Both of them shook their heads. They could not see a wink.</p><p>\u201cVery well, now we\u2019re off,\u201d said the Brownie.</p><p>He took Jack\u2019s hand on one side, and Margaret\u2019s on the other. It seemed as if they flew through the window. They went on swiftly for a little while, then the Brownie whirled them round and round until they were dizzy, and off they went again. The children could not tell whether they were going north, south, east, or west. After a time they stopped.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d said the Brownie.</p><p>He uncovered their eyes, and the children saw that they were standing before a big, thick gate.</p><p>The Brownie knocked and the gate was swung open. They went through it, right into Santa Claus\u2019s garden.</p><p>It was a very queer garden. There were rows and rows of Christmas trees, all glittering with balls and cobwebby tinsel, and instead of flower beds there were beds of every kind of toy in the world. Margaret at once ran over to a bed of dolls.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if any of them are ripe,\u201d said the Brownie.</p><p>\u201cRipe?\u201d said Margaret in great surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Brownie. \u201cNow if this one is ripe it will shut its eyes.\u201d</p><p>The Brownie picked a little doll from the bed and laid it in Margaret\u2019s arms. Its eyes went half shut, and then stuck.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not ripe yet,\u201d said the Brownie. \u201cTry this one.\u201d</p><p>He picked another one, and this one shut its eyes just as if it had gone to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take that one,\u201d he said, and he dropped it into a big sack he was carrying.</p><p>\u201cNow this one cries, if it\u2019s ripe,\u201d he said as he picked a lovely infant doll. The Brownie gave it a squeeze, and the doll made a funny squeaking noise.</p><p>\u201cNot quite ripe,\u201d he said, and he put it back into the bed. He tried several others, and he picked a good many. Some of them cried, some said \u201cMamma\u201d and \u201cPapa,\u201d and some danced when they were wound up.</p><p>\u201cOh, do come over here, Margaret!\u201d Jack called.</p><p>Margaret ran over to another bed and there were drums\u2014big drums, little drums, and middle sized drums; yellow drums, blue drums, green drums, red drums.</p><p>\u201cCan we gather some of these?\u201d said Jack to the Brownie.</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course. Let\u2019s see if this one is ripe.\u201d</p><p>The Brownie took up a little red drum, and gave it a thump with a drum stick. But it made such a queer sound that Jack and Margaret both laughed out loud. The little red drum was put back into the bed, and the Brownie tried another big one. It went Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! and Jack and Margaret marched all along the bed, keeping step to it.</p><p>When they had finished picking drums, they went over to a bed filled with horns. That was the most fun of all. Some of them made very queer noises, and on some the Brownie played jolly little tunes.</p><p>The next bed they came to was filled with toys which could be wound up. There were trains, automobiles, dancing dolls, climbing monkeys, hopping birds, funny wobbling ducks, and every kind of toy you could think of. The children stayed at this bed for a long time.</p><p>At last Margaret said: \u201cBut where is Santa Claus? We wanted to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, to be sure,\u201d said the Brownie. \u201cCome along,\u201d and he led them down a long, winding walk, to the edge of the garden. Then he pointed to a hill in the distance.</p><p>\u201cDo you see that large white house? There is where he lives.\u201d</p><p>The children stared at it. It was so white that it seemed to shine in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWalk right across here,\u201d said the Brownie, \u201cthen up the hill to Santa Claus\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, must we walk across there?\u201d said Margaret. She stared down into the deep dark chasm, a scary drop between the garden and the hill. Across it was stretched a narrow plank.</p><p>\u201cWalk carefully,\u201d said the Brownie, \u201cand mind you don\u2019t look down; for if you do, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t see Santa Claus to-night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be very careful,\u201d said Jack. \u201cCome along, Margaret,\u201d and he took his little sister\u2019s hand and they started across the plank.</p><p>They had almost reached the middle of it when Jack looked down.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d he said, and gave Margaret a pull.</p><p>She looked down too, and cried \u201cOh, Oh!\u201d and down, down, down they went.</p><p>Suddenly they landed with a thump. They sat up and rubbed their eyes. There they were right in their own beds at home. Mother opened the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake, children?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mother, we haven\u2019t been asleep. We\u2019ve been to Santa Claus Land, and we nearly saw Santa Claus!\u201d</p><p>Then they told her all about it, and Mother just smiled.</p>"}
