This is so beautiful,\u201d Piggi said to his brother Giggi.</p><p>Giggi widened his eyes and replied \u2013 \u201cYes\u2026and it seems that it is laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s\u00a0go inside and\u00a0see,\u201d Giggi replied.</p><p>And they went inside the house hopping and jumping giggling.</p><p>After entering the house, they felt as if the doors\u00a0and the windows were smiling and would burst into laughter any moment.</p><p>Piggy asked surprisingly \u2013 \u201cI am having a very strange feeling again. I feel as if everything inside the house is smiling.\u201d</p><p>Giggi replied \u2013 \u201cAnd I can hear the sound of giggling also.\u201d</p><p>Just then Piggi looked at the ceiling fan and cried \u2013\u201cLo and behold! This fan is laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Since both of you are very innocent and kind-hearted kids and we are quite pleased to see you here,\u201d the fan giggled.</p><p>Piggi smiled back \u2013 \u201cIs this a magical house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay be\u2026\u2026may not be\u2026.hahaha!\u201d the dining table laughed loudly and replied.</p><p>\u201cActually we keep watching you in the playground every day. We always feel happy when you help someone.\u201d Pink flowerpot with blue roses came forward and the flowers shook in admiration.</p><p>Piggi and Giggi were puzzled and looked at each other.</p><p>Giggi asked surprisingly \u2013 \u201cBut we don\u2019t recall what we have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the way, you found one puppy lying injured on the road and you had applied ointment and fed him biscuits.\u201d</p><p>A soft voice came from far corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh! Who is it?\u201d Piggi bent and looked under the dining table.</p><p>\u201cMe..it\u2019s me..Just look at the window over here,\u201d announced Purple curtain and smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut we both had forgotten this incident. We did not feel anything special about what we had done,\u201d Giggi replied without any pride.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026.because helping others is your nature and this house always welcomes good children like you who are always ready to help others.\u201d</p><p>Giggi asked innocently \u00a0-\u201cCan our friends also come? They too are very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We all will wait for all of you,\u201d said the wall, which was very quite so far.</p><p>Piggi said \u2013 \u201cWe will tell all our friends about all of you and will bring them here and we will have a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Piggi and Giggi burst out in laughter and left for the house to share this wonderful experience with their mother and friends.</p>"}
