When Green comes along, he lights up and says, \u2018Go\u2019 everyone listens to him before they whizz off. Nobody really knows I\u2019m here. Sometimes they will look at me quickly but they prefer to listen to Green and Red.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not true,\u2019 replied Little Red Car, \u2018every job is important.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Amber, will you stop talking to that car?\u2019 shouted Green. \u2018I have just lit up and it needs to move.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Green, are you still going on about your brightness, sure you know people would love to stare at me all day,\u2019 boasted Red.</p><p>Day after day, Green and Red argued about who had the best job.\u00a0 Amber wished that they didn\u2019t fight all the time. Green and Red didn\u2019t even know what job Amber did.</p><p>It was the day of the annual farmer\u2019s truck competition and the traffic got really busy because lots of trucks carrying bales of hay go through the town.\u00a0 The traffic lights get really excited about this as it means they have to work extra hard that day.</p><p>Amber loves it because she gets to see all the different trucks.\u00a0 They come in funny shapes and sizes.\u00a0 She especially wanted to see Dodge the Truck.\u00a0 He was always nice to her.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t carry as much hay as the rest of them so he always had time to talk.</p><p>The roar of the engines was heard in the distance.</p><p>\u2018Ok, I am going to light up first,\u2019 announced Red. \u2018We don\u2019t want those other lights at junction Cropper thinking we can\u2019t do this.\u00a0 I want all the new trucks seeing me.\u2019</p><p>Amber looked at the trucks coming down the road.\u00a0 It was the finest parade she had ever seen. All the trucks were gleaming and smiling proudly.</p><p>\u2018Hello Amber, how are you?\u2019 Dodge said, as he pulled up.</p><p>Amber opened her mouth to reply but Green started shouting, \u2018Come along now Dodge, it\u2019s my turn to light up and we need to keep the traffic moving.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hang on,\u2019 said Red, \u2018I was being looked at, it\u2019s not your turn.\u2019</p><p>Green closed his eyes and puffed out his cheeks. \u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll show you how bright I can get.\u2019\u00a0 He lit up as bright as he could. \u2018Now, you all need to move along,\u2019 he ordered.</p><p>The trucks smiled at Green and began to move along.</p><p>\u2018Wait there!\u2019 demanded Red.</p><p>He did the same and lit up as bright as he could.</p><p>Dodge was the first to see Red as he was in front of the line. He tried to stop but his wheels kept moving.</p><p>\u2018Oh no, I\u2019m going to meet the other trucks at the junction,\u2019 he cried.</p><p>Next thing Dodge crashed into the biggest truck of hay coming along the opposite side of him. The hay from the truck tipped over him and covered his windows.</p><p>\u2018Now look what you did,\u2019 Red yelled to Green, \u2018I told you it was my turn.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did that,\u2019 snapped Green, \u2018I\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>Green started to light up but instead his light began to fade.</p><p>\u2018Hah,\u2019 snorted Red, \u2018you can\u2019t light up as much as me.\u00a0 This is how it\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>Red closed his eyes and tried to light up but it didn\u2019t work either.</p><p>Amber was watching and became worried. Red and Green\u2019s lights were starting to disappear completely. She had to do something, but what? She was only amber light, so who would listen to her?</p><p>\u2018Hey what are we supposed to do?\u2019 shouted a steam truck.\u00a0 \u2018Should we move or stay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think we should see what Amber has in mind!\u2019 Dodge yelled out.</p><p>The noise of the horns was getting louder. There was hay everywhere and trucks all piled on top of each other.</p><p>Amber could hear Dodge\u2019s voice, \u2018Amber, quick you need to do something!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What can I do?\u2019 she asked.</p><p>\u2018You need to turn your light on so we know to slow down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2026but no one ever looks at me as they are always too busy looking at Green and Red.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not true,\u2019 replied Dodge. All the traffic lights have an important job. \u2018We look at Amber so we know when to slow down and we know Red is next and we need to stop.\u00a0 Then we wait for Green so we can go again. You need to shine now and tell everyone to slow down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ok, I will try,\u2019 said Amber.</p><p>Amber closed her eyes and puffed out her cheeks.\u00a0 She could feel her light shining. \u2018Ok, this is it,\u2019 she thought. \u2018I know I can do this.\u00a0 This is what I\u2019ve always been practising.\u2019</p><p>She could hear Dodge calling out, \u2018Now everybody, please watch Amber and listen to her carefully.\u2019</p><p>When Amber opened her eyes, she was amazed when she saw that she was finally being watched and that the cars were slowing down</p><p>\u2018Ok cars,\u2019 she said, \u2018keep watching me, and slow your engines down and listen to me carefully, as this is where Red would usually come in and tell you to stop.\u2019</p><p>One by one the trucks started to slow down.\u00a0 Eventually they slowed down so much that their engines finally stopped.</p><p>\u2018Great job everyone,\u2019 Amber praised. \u2018Now cars, you need to wait here for a bit and let the cars move across at junction Cropper.\u00a0 Next is where Green would usually tell you to go, but make sure all the cars are completely stopped and there is nothing in your way before you move on though.\u2019</p><p>One by one, the cars at junction Cropper started to move slowly and make their way down the road.</p><p>All the trucks cheered, \u2018Hooray! Thank you Amber for showing us what to do.\u2019</p><p>Just then Green and Red\u2019s lights started to light up a bit.</p><p>\u2018Amber, you saved the day!\u2019 cried Green.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 added Red, \u2018I suppose you were good at your job today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 squealed Amber. \u2018Now I know why all the traffic lights are important.\u00a0 I do get looked at after all!\u2019</p><p>From that day on Amber was never sad again.</p>"}
