She was bored, bored, bored. It was a relief when her phone beeped telling her a text had arrived, which she quickly opened.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/01_Panel1_Start_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>HAPPY BDAY D. SHARON XX</p><p>She scowled at it and quickly thumbed a response.</p><p>THX SHAR @ LEAST SUM1 REMEMBRD. DEIRDRE</p><p>Her dad\u2019s jacket lying across the back seat struck her attention. Reaching back to it, she felt her way through all its pockets. She found what she was looking for \u2013 her dad\u2019s credit card. Serves him right, she thought. She looked around guiltily, then stuffed it into her purse. She jumped out of the car.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/02_Panel2_CardStealer_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>The moving crowd of Saturday shoppers carried her along towards the main shopping area. She passed a shop window that caught her eye. It displayed a large poster of a kindly-looking man\u2019s face. Her curiosity made her to stop and examine the words underneath:</p><p>Your OWN father figure \u2013 Yes, YOUR OWN DREAM DADDY</p><p>\u00a0And at DREAM Prices \u2013 a lot less than you think!</p><p>Don\u2019t delay \u2013 Visit Dream Daddies TODAY</p><p>Deirdre paused for a moment and stared open-mouthed at the poster. She considered what to do. An impulse led her to push the door open and enter. Why not? she thought. She knew she looked older than she was. The bell rang out as the door closed behind her.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/03_Panel3_Dreamdaddyshop_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>She approached the counter. A young well-dressed man appeared from a hidden area behind it. He was wearing a glossy-looking suit with a pink spotted tie. His hair was greased flat from front to back.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, \u201cmy name is Frank Stitch. Welcome to Dream Daddies. How can I help you this fine morning?\u201d He smiled, showed off a perfect row of gleaming white teeth. Frank wondered if she was old enough to be here on her own, but thought better of asking. Sales were slow and he needed all the business he could get.</p><p>\u201cI just noticed the poster in the window,\u201d said Deirdre.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic! And your name is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeirdre. Deirdre Deering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic!\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cHow does it work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple, Deirdre,\u201d replied Frank. \u201cWe have a huge selection of programmable father dummies in the warehouse out back. The dummies are all base-programmed with different personalities. No two dummies are ever the same. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be natural. However, they can also be changed if you have any special requests.\u201d</p><p>Frank searched into her eyes and saw her imagination being captured by the idea.</p><p>\u201cWe simply take your requirements. We match them with the dummy personality profiles available in the warehouse. Once we have identified a matching dummy, we do the final programming. We load him up with your relevant information. Strong traces of his original personality programming will remain. We can, however, customise somewhat. You don\u2019t have to make your final decision until you meet him. Then you sign a contract, pay the setup fee and take him home. It couldn\u2019t be simpler, Deirdre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d asked Deirdre, her eyes as wide as the moon.</p><p>\u201cWhat price fatherly perfection, Deirdre? You can have your very own Dream Daddy from only two thousand setup fee plus two hundred a month. For a small fee, we can also program annoying habits in from time to time. We find it makes things more, realistic so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take?\u201d</p><p>Frank went in to close the sale. He was often told he was a great closer. A salesman is trained to close the sale.</p><p>\u201cThe process is completely computerised. We narrow down to the ideal match. Then we program immediately with your details. All the dummies have their brains connected to our network. We can do the programming from here in a matter of minutes.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre took a step back. She was astonished that she could leave the shop with a new father so quickly and conveniently.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d she cried.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/04_Panel4_Salesman_intro_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic!\u201d said Frank as he smiled one of his shiny smiles once more. He stepped out from behind the counter and put his arm around her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s move to the programming suite immediately.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre could feel her heart beating in her chest as Frank led her through a door at the side of the counter. The entered a booth with a computer terminal where they both sat down. The booth had posters of all manner of fathers with their children all around it. Father on a boat with the kids. Father camping in the sunshine by a river. Father giving a piggy-back. There was even a father playing with his daughter\u2019s dollies and laughing his head off. Everyone was smiling. The fathers, the mothers, the daughters, the sons, the grandparents, even the dog in one picture appeared to have a large grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWe\u2019ll start to narrow it down based on your preferences.\u201d</p><p>Frank typed in Deirdre\u2019s name and clicked on START. A message appeared on the screen.</p><p>3598 DUMMIES AVAILABLE</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find your dream daddy,\u201d said Frank, grinning at Deirdre. \u201cGive me your first preference. Whatever comes into your head first is best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes not perform long belches at the dinner table,\u201d said Deirdre without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>Frank looked at her. \u201cYou mean accidentally or on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I can\u2019t stand all that when I\u2019m trying to eat. He thinks it\u2019s funny. Er, I mean it\u2019s not funny when they do that, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d said Frank. He typed in \u201cDoes not belch at dinner table.\u201d</p><p>The screen went blank and then appeared with the message:</p><p>2435 DUMMIES REMAINING</p><p>\u201cMmmm, that seems to have narrowed it down quite a bit. It seems burping performances are more common than I would have expected. Still, no worries, still plenty of choice left. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHates watching sport on television or in pubs,\u201d she spat.</p><p>Frank shrugged and typed in the instruction. The computer returned its answer:</p><p>362 DUMMIES REMAINING</p><p>Frank started to mop his brow and turned to Deirdre.</p><p>\u201cThat rules out quite a few, Deirdre. Make sure now you mention the most important criteria first. The field has narrowed quite considerably already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever gets annoyed and shouts at their daughter, spit flying everywhere so that it sprays into your face and gets in your eye.\u201d</p><p>Frank raised an eyebrow as he typed in the command. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he commented.</p><p>353 DUMMIES REMAINING</p><p>\u201cAh, not too many of those, thank goodness!\u201d commented Frank.</p><p>\u201cAlways lets me watch my programmes on TV whenever I want, even if his favourite show is on and gives me the best place on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs any decent dad would,\u201d said Frank clicking furiously on the keyboard.</p><p>11 DUMMIES REMAINING</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re getting places,\u201d cried Frank.</p><p>\u201cWould never forget my birthday,\u201d replied Deirdre. Her face was set.</p><p>Frank turned back to the keyboard and entered the command. The reply was instant.</p><p>5 DUMMIES REMAINING</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Frank. \u201cQuite a few forgetful ones I see. That was fast. I\u2019ve never seen the numbers come down that quick before. Still, we have five matches for you. Want to limit further? I can\u2019t guarantee that anything else you ask for won\u2019t rule them all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fat one,\u201d said Deirdre. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the way he\u2026, I mean I couldn\u2019t stand a slob that lies around all day.\u201d</p><p>Frank entered \u201cNot fat\u201d and pressed ENTER.</p><p>1 DUMMY REMAINING. PERFECT FIT SELECTED.</p><p>PROCEED TO DUMMY PROGRAMMING?</p><p>Frank smiled at Deirdre. \u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic! I think we found your man. Next stage is to proceed to program him with all your details. First I\u2019ll take your photograph so he\u2019ll recognise you. Then you enter information about yourself so he\u2019s aware of the important details of your life. \u00a0Say CHEESE!\u201d</p><p>Deirdre smiled as Frank used a camera attached to the unit to take her picture. Then he clicked on the keyboard and offered it to Deirdre to start typing the information.</p><p>\u201cCall for me when you are ready,\u201d he said as he left the cubicle.</p><p>After thirty minutes of furious typing Deirdre pushed the keyboard away and sat back.</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019m finished!\u201d she cried out. Frank appeared almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cThat was great!\u201d enthused Deirdre. \u201cI told him all about my first day at school and about how I came first in the class in Home Economics and how I always wanted to be a ballerina when I was small and \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic!\u201d interrupted Frank. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he needs to know. Now tell me, there are a couple more options. Would you like him Strong Silent, Standard Warm-hearted or Super Sentimental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper Sentimental please,\u201d replied Deirdre without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>\u201cOK, great, that\u2019s done. Now, finally, we find it useful if you both do something together straight away. To complete the bonding so to speak. So we\u2019ll program him with an idea so he thinks it comes from himself. Anything you would fancy doing with him this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the movies and then go for a pizza!\u201d giggled Deirdre with delight.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d replied Frank. \u201cLet me input the last few instructions and \u2026 there! All done. Now, let\u2019s go to the meeting bay, he\u2019ll be ready in just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Just as they arrived at the door to the bay, out came a large middle aged man. He was holding the arm of an elderly gent with a walking stick and sporting a bandage around his head.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon pop,\u201d said the man, \u201cwhere\u2019d you like to go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get us a couple of chocolate sundaes,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy treat, I want to hear all the gory details about your flower-arranging championship win. I\u2019m so proud you retained your title, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call, pops, sounds great. I\u2019ll take you home later and give you a nice bed bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re too kind, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre and Frank entered the room. They sat down to wait in front of a closed double door underneath a screen displaying:</p><p>DEIRDRE DEERING\u2019S DREAM DADDY WAIT TIME IS 4 MINUTES</p><p>Deirdre fidgeted with excitement while the minutes counted down. \u00a0Her eyes were glued to the screen. Three minutes. Two minutes. One minute. The last minute felt like hours.</p><p>Finally, the doors opened. In walked a tall, lean man with a bandage around his head. Comfortably dressed, he was wearing a checked jacket with leather elbow patches and casual trousers. As soon as he saw Deirdre, he smiled and walked over to her with arms outstretched.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/05_Panel5_RoboDad_entry_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cDeirdre, princess, it\u2019s so great to see you. You look wonderful. Come over here and give Daddy a great big hug.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre stood up and received the embrace. She closed her eyes and tried to hold back the tears as she hugged him.</p><p>\u201cSo, Deirdre, what does my birthday girl want to do today? How about a movie and then Pizza Palace? We can take it from there. No pubs though \u2013 you know how I feel about pubs. And they\u2019re full of noisy louts in shiny-coloured jerseys glued to TV screens showing equally stupid men running after balls in big fields. Ridiculous. Maybe after the pizza I could take you and buy you an extravagant dress for your birthday? Please?\u201d</p><p>Deirdre looked him in the eye and said \u201cMovie and pizza would be great dad, thanks. And there is this dress in \u201cThe Ridiculous Expense Dress Company\u201d \u2013 the designer section \u2013 that I\u2019ve been dreamin\u2019 about for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deirdre, it would make me so happy to get it for you.\u201d</p><p>As they were leaving, Frank raised an eyebrow to Deirdre. He slid a contract and a credit card terminal to Deirdre. She took out the stolen credit card from her purse, put it into the device and entered the pin number that she had memorised from the past. Finally, she half-glanced over the contract and scribbled a signature. She shook hands with Frank.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. Fantastic,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>They headed for the exit. Dream Daddy stepped forward and opened the door for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited we\u2019re going to spend quality time, Honey-kins,\u201d he said as she stepped out.</p><p>On the street, she looked around nervously as they linked arms and headed in the direction of the Savoy cinema. They only got a few yards, when she heard a shout behind her.</p><p>\u201cOY! There you are! You little cheeky good-for-nothing! I told you to stay in the car while I was in the betting office!\u201d This was followed by a long, loud belch.</p><p>Her heart sank. They both turned around and saw him standing ten yards back. He was middle aged, unshaven, with a glossy red jersey clinging to his oversized belly. His tummy looked like a bowling ball had been stuffed under the front his shirt. He noticed the man attached to Deirdre\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWho is THAT?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cAnd what\u2019s he doing on your arm?\u201d</p><p>He started to stride towards them, his face hard and furious. Dream Daddy slipped behind Deirdre. He put his hands on her shoulders.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/06_Panel6_Confrontation_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>\u201cI have no idea who you are,\u201d he called over her shoulder towards the angry man. \u201cBut I insist you do not speak to my daughter in that manner. Your language is not appropriate in front of a young lady. If you do not desist, I will have no option but to contact the authorities.\u201d</p><p>The approaching man stopped. He gaped for a moment with his eyes wide open.</p><p>\u201cYOUR daughter? Are you mad? I\u2019m Pat Deering and that\u2019s MY daughter you thick oaf! Are you some sort of sugar daddy? Get your hands off my girl, NOW!\u201d Spit sprayed out of his mouth and all over their faces.</p><p>\u201cCover your ears, his tone is quite aggressive,\u201d cried Dream Daddy, crouching lower behind her.</p><p>Just then, Pat turned and looked at the shop.</p><p>\u201cDream Daddies, I heard of that. Isn\u2019t that the place where they turn dummies into\u2026.bloomin\u2019 heck Deirdre? Just wait till I get my hands on you. And where did you get the money to pay for\u2026\u2026Mother of Divine Mercy Deirdre, my credit card! I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. I usually keep it in my jacket pocket and it was gone. You little\u2026..\u201d</p><p>He charged towards them. Dream Daddy pushed Deirdre at Pat and then tried to run back to the shop by circling around him on the road. He never saw the truck coming. He was bounced into the air and landed in a heap next to them. \u00a0As people started to gather in shock, he started to twitch violently on the footpath, gibbering. Wires and electronics tumbled out from the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cMovie love? Wanna catch a movie love? Movie? Pizza? Movie and a pizza love? Movie? Pizza, Movie? Pizza? Movieeeeeeeeeeeeee Pizzaaaaaaaaaaa Movieeeeeeeeee Pizzaaaaaaaa \u2026.\u201d</p><p>Finally in one last gasp, he went silent and then limp.</p><p>Deirdre knelt on the pavement beside him. She broke down in tears as she stroked his forehead.</p><p>\u201cPerfect, he was!\u201d she cried. \u201cAbsolutely perfect!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/07_Panel7_Sad_Dierdre_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>Her father approached. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d he replied, sobbing. \u201cDeirdre. How could you? I am your true dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d roared Deirdre. \u201cYou\u2019re a useless slob of a father who never does anything nice. You didn\u2019t even remember my birthday today!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, his brow creased. \u201cYou never said it was your stupid birthday,\u201d he replied. \u201cHow was I supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dad, I\u2019m not supposed to have to remind you! I\u2019ve had it with you, you are no longer my dad, ok? You\u2019re fired!\u201d</p><p>Pat\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a fish in a tank, shocked by his daughter\u2019s words, casting him away. He looked to the ground and scratched around with his toe.</p><p>\u201cYour man. The dream daddy. Did you really like him better than me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was brilliant, yeah,\u201d replied Deirdre. \u201cHe was taking me for pizza after the movies. He was begging me to buy me a dress. An expensive one.\u201d</p><p>A silence ensued. Pat looked at his daughter with doggy eyes, full of hurt.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was a bit of a chicken alright,\u201d she continued.</p><p>Another silence ensued.</p><p>\u201cMovies and pizza, eh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cForget it, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh c\u2019mon, I wouldn\u2019t mind it myself anyway. What d\u2019ya say? I heard Top Killer is excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I want to see Handsome Prince Love Story 2 \u2013 After the Wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh no, what d\u2019ya want to see that rubbish for? I\u2019d have to bring the sick bucket.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre threw her head on her dream daddy\u2019s chest and started to sob.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, just turn off the Niagra Falls. For goodness sake.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care about me!\u201d she cried. All you care about is your stupid football and getting the longest belches possible at the dinner table! You\u2019re a lazy slob, dad. God only knows what my poor mum saw in you. If she was alive now she\u2019d be turning in her grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d cried her Dad. \u201cSee this.\u201d He flung his wallet at her. She caught it before it tumbled to the ground. She looked at her dad and then opened it up. Inside she found a picture of herself as a small girl.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cI carry your silly picture around everywhere! Ever since your mum died I never knew what to do with you. What do I know about girls? I didn\u2019t have any sisters. I spent the first few years of your life trying to teach you to talk and the next ten trying to get you to shut up! But Deirdre, whenever I look at that picture in my wallet, I feel really proud of you, so I do. I just never knew how to tell you. I guess I luh\u2026I guess I luh\u2026.\u201d</p><p>Pat stopped and gathered all his strength.</p><p>\u201cAh Deirdre. Don\u2019t you know\u00a0 I love ya? Please, let me still be your dad?\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/08_Panel8_Reconcilation_wrk-opt.jpg'></img><p>Deirdre looked at him in amazement. She stared for a moment before replying. A half-smile crept onto her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou had me at \u2018I carry your silly picture\u2019, Dad.\u201d She approached him. She tried to hug him, but her arms only reached half-way around his stomach. He replied by flopping his arms from side to side and then finally putting them awkwardly around her.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s go to the movies so,\u201d she said. \u201cThen pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so quick, after the match, right? It\u2019s the cup final, I need to see that one. I have a bet on. Then the movies. Then pizza. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre raised her eyes to heaven and thumped him in the shoulder. She looped her arm in his as they walked back towards the car.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Dream-Daddy-characters_v2-opt.jpg'></img>"}
