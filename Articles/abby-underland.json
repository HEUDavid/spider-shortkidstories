She knocked, waited, and opened the door, but he didn\u2019t stir from where he sat absorbed in a book. From the look of the volumes that lined the looming shelves, this was a learned prince.</p><p>She widened her eyes until they glowed to study the boy, a twelve-year-old like Abby. Lost in wonder, she spilled the goblet of amber liquid, which fanned across the floor.</p><p>The prince, with his blond brows creased and his blue eyes piercing, pivoted on the throne-like chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d The purplish gem on his forehead cast a circle of light around the chamber.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Abby-from-Underland-illustration-by-Doreen-Diorio-opt.jpg'></img><p>Abby jumped back and trembled. \u201cI . . . uh . . . !\u201d She shook her head of coppery hair, unable to speak. What\u2019s the use in defending myself? she thought. I\u2019m a hated stranger in his Gemfolk realm. Would the prince call the guard stationed outside to haul her off to prison? It was possible.</p><p>During the last dismal month Abby had lived in the castle. She\u2019d wandered off from a class trip above Underland and had been captured by a Gemguard. The guard called her a spy and dragged her to Gemland. Abby was cleared of the charge, but she couldn\u2019t find her way back home. She became a scullery maid and the castle steward barked about her constant lateness. She slipped and slid across the pearly floors and couldn\u2019t seem to get to any one place\u2014the kitchen, the banquet hall, or the royal chambers\u2014on time. Even the other servants snubbed her as an outcast foreigner.</p><p>Prince Nathan just laughed and helped Abby mop up the spill. Then he motioned for her to take the plush chair beside his desk.</p><p>\u201cThank you . . . your high . . . ness,\u201d Abby stammered in dumbfounded surprise. She climbed onto the chair, designed for tall Gemfolk, not a girl of her petite stature.</p><p>\u201cI ask those I wish to know better to call me Nate.\u201d The gem, no bigger than a coin, spread a halo of purple across his smiling face.</p><p>\u201cWell, call me Abby.\u201d She returned Nate\u2019s warm smile and squinted at the strange gem joined onto the skin on his forehead. It appeared delicate with its curved facets, still she shielded her eyes from the strength of its beam.</p><p>Nate shrugged. \u201cMy gem brightens when I feel . . .\u201d He trailed off as a shy blush colored his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d Abby ventured to ask.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know you, Abby from Underland!\u201d Nate gripped her hand with a throbbing shake. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an actual Underlander.\u201d He soared up to the topmost shelf, hefted a weighty text, and landed beside his desk.\u00a0 \u201cYour people should be praised, not scorned,\u201d he said in a matter-of-fact-voice.</p><p>Abby\u2019s heart soared like the winged creatures of Mish, a remote region of dizzying heights. Had she\u2014along with her misunderstood people\u2014found had a royal ally in this prince?</p><p>Nate flipped the pages of the book, ran his finger down a passage, and read out loud: \u201c\u2018Underlanders, known for their mysterious dreams are a race of cave dwellers. Whilst the Ancients once honored Underland, suspicion of their dream magic drove them deeper into the underground.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is something of a joke among us.\u201d Abby leaned over the chair to tap the page. \u201cMy people live inside houses my ancestors built into our caves. This myth kept us hidden until we grew apart from the upper world. After many moons, our white eyes glowed in the lightless mazes of our underground home.\u201d Her head dropped to her chest. \u201cNow the rest of the planet despises our dream visions as a kind of dark magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s high time then.\u201d Nate rubbed his chin as he watched Abby with a thoughtful look. \u201cThe world must embrace Underland again.\u201d</p><p>Abby stared out the window and sighed. The spires of Gemland Castle, unlike the softness of her earthy home, clawed the sky like fingernails of glass. She expected nothing in this hostile place where, worst of all, she\u2019d lost the power of her dreams in the light-filled realm. How else could she find her way home?</p><p>\u201cGood prince, it\u2019s enough that you embrace my people,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat I do, Abby!\u201d Nate thumped her back and she lurched forward on the seat. \u201cAnd I honor the gift of your magical dreams.\u201d</p><p>Abby could no longer claim that gift, but Nate\u2019s merry laugh lifted her spirits.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">#</p><p>Tension gripped Abby like a squeezing fist as they waited in the throne room. She\u2019d agreed to meet the king and queen, but this had been Nate\u2019s idea. Although Abby longed speak up for her people, she fought an eerie unease. She pondered Nate\u2019s description of his parents as traditional folks who followed the old Gemland ways. Had their traditions prejudiced them against Underland?</p><p>Abby peered from where she hid behind Nate at the glistening thrones across the room. Behind the thrones, a high window stretched to the dome of a vaulted ceiling. A serpentine tunnel wound its way down to an oval courtyard below the window. The tunnel spiraled from the throne room to the top of the castle, the highest spire in the land.</p><p>Abby drew a deep breath as she felt herself shrink within the palatial room. Lights speckled the floor in a myriad of dotted rainbows. The forest where she\u2019d emerged from Underland what seemed like ages before looked faraway through the window. Abby\u2019s parents must have tried to find her, but how could they have crossed the guarded border? They might wind up being captured by Gemguards, too.</p><p>Abby wagged her head at the window in sorrow. She\u2019d snuck off from her class to pick flowers for her sister\u2019s birthday and, dazzled in the sunlit field, had been seized. Ever since, she pined for her family, her friends, and her cozy room at home. To top it off, she felt even more lost without the guiding visions of her dreams.</p><p>Two uniformed guards ducked under the tunnel\u2019s mouth and flew to stand beside the thrones. One blew a gleaming trumpet and thundered, \u201cAll hail, King Reginald and Queen Monica!\u201d</p><p>The gemstones on the guards\u2019 and Nate\u2019s foreheads lit with the sweep of their bows. Abby, bowing beside Nate, ground her teeth at the thought of what her people viewed as servile homage. For the sake of Nate\u2019s friendship, she bore the indignity.</p><p>In a swirl of iridescent, white robes, the king and queen swooped out of the tunnel and settled onto their thrones. Like their son, they were fair-skinned, golden-haired, and tall. Unlike their friendly son, frowns sharpened their drawn faces.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you troubled us, Prince Nathan?\u201d King Reginald\u2019s question rang out. \u201cWe were about to embark on a Royal Hunt.\u201d</p><p>Nate had told Abby how his parents spent most of their time engaged in hunts and lavish banquets.</p><p>\u201cFather, Mother,\u201d Nate met their eyes, piercing blue like his, \u201cI would not have asked for this audience without just cause.\u201d He patted Abby\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve made a trustworthy friend in Abigail from Underland. I pray you hear us out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you disgrace us like this?\u201d The queen\u2019s gem sparked with pink lights as she clutched her face in her hands. \u201cYou were warned of the dark magic of her people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Nathan, you will not attempt to see this vile foreigner again,\u201d the king snarled at Nate and fixed a glare on Abby. \u201cWe rescued you from your dingy Underland to dwell in our glorious kingdom and you poison our son\u2019s mind! Is this how you redeem the name of your roguish people in our eyes?\u201d</p><p>The scorn she\u2019d put up with for six homesick months formed on Abby\u2019s tongue. She raised her eyes to boldly meet the king\u2019s glare and cried out, \u201cYour son alone redeemed your people in my eyes!\u201d</p><p>A shocked silence followed the pulsing echo of Abby\u2019s words. Even Nate nudged her side, but Abby, who\u2019d heard enough\u2014too many\u2014insults, didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The queen slapped the armrest of her throne and demanded her guard to, \u201cRemove this insolent girl from our presence!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuards, seize the Underlander!\u201d the king ordered.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, Father, please!\u201d Nate clasped his hands in a pleading gesture. \u201cAbby, I\u2019m so sorry\u2013!\u201d</p><p>The queen\u2019s guard rushed over and thrust out his arm to hold Nate, who flailed his arms.</p><p>\u201cLet him be!\u201d Abby lunged to defend her friend.</p><p>The king\u2019s burly guard lumbered toward Abby and barked, \u201cHold your tongue, girl.\u201d He dragged her out of the door, which slammed with a deafening clang. He rose in the air and carried Abby in flight down a twisty corridor.</p><p>Nate\u2019s loud protests rang out in the hallway as Abby\u2019s mind whirled. Will I ever see the prince, my only friend in Gemland, again? </p><p>The guard\u2019s coarse fingers dug into her arms until they landed before a padlocked door. \u201cSee to our guest\u2019s accommodations.\u201d He jerked his beard at a scruffy gray-haired warden who unlatched the door.</p><p>The guard lifted Abby by the neckline of her tunic and dropped her on the dungeon floor. The door shut with a thud and the guard\u2019s and warden\u2019s boot-steps faded outside. Abby widened her eyes until they glowed with white to scan the musty dungeon. Its cracked stones sloped in a ceiling, which was laced with straggled moss. \u201cJust like,\u201d she sputtered with anger, \u201cbut not my home!\u201d</p><p>A solitary tear coursed down Abby\u2019s cheek. How could she survive imprisonment to return her beloved homeland? She wept into her palms, clamped shut her eyes, and, drained by the struggle, lapsed into slumber.</p><p>A vision wove its way into her dream. Nate\u2019s smiling face, lit by the circular glow of his gem, greeted her within the dream. He lifted a finger toward a forest path and Abby took it as a sign of hope. Hadn\u2019t Nate reminded her? She was descended from a race of gifted people. Abby\u2019s path became clear through the seeing magic of her dream. Somehow she would escape to return to her people.</p><p>First she needed to garner her strength, which for any Underlander stemmed from sleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">#</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The door opened with a noisy squeak that woke Abby whose temper surged.\u00a0\u201cWhat now?\u201d To awaken a dreaming Underlander was the height of insult.</p><p>\u201cYou, cave dweller, a castle soldier\u2019s come to take you to court.\u201d The warden jerked a bony thumb behind him. \u201cYou\u2019d better not make him wait!\u201d</p><p>Abby, too groggy to argue, stood on wobbly legs to follow him out of the dungeon. The mustached soldier thrust her head first through a back door. She dropped, her limbs splayed, onto the cobblestones of a grimy alleyway.</p><p>\u201cYow!\u201d Abby rubbed her stinging chin.</p><p>The moment the warden slammed the door, the soldier bent over Abby. \u201cForgive my bad manners, Miss Abigail, but your escape must appear believable,\u201d he explained in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Abby, baffled by his sudden kindness, squinted from where she sprawled on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much time before sunrise. Quick, grab hold of my feet,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>Her jumbled thoughts raced as Abby crawled further down the alleyway. The soldier moved toward her and she sidled against a gap in the stone wall. Its opening, big enough for Abby to slip into, was too narrow for the towering soldier.</p><p>Just then, her dream-vision flashed to mind. Maybe this wasn\u2019t another prejudiced Gemfolk who had come to seize her. Abby sensed that she needed to trust the mysterious soldier. She sucked in a deep breath, struggled to her feet, and took a step toward him.</p><p>She knelt to clutch the soldier\u2019s boots and his golden buttons jangled as they flew above the pavement. He maneuvered the dusky maze of alleys and Abby\u2019s bare feet slapped the corners of buildings. She bit her lip to keep from yelping.</p><p>They came to a foggy road and soared over it to the kingdom\u2019s border. Then they alighted on the shadowy edge of the forest.\u00a0Abby spied a shrouded figure lurking between the trees and gasped. Had she misunderstod her dream-vision? Did the soldier lead me into a trap?</p><p>She backed up, ready to scamper into the forest when the hood fell back to unveil Nate\u2019s smiling face. Abby flung her arms around the prince.</p><p>\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t suffered, my friend.\u201d Nate\u2019s forehead creased with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cNot much, Nate.\u201d Abby shook his upturned hand. \u201cIt took imprisonment in that dark, lightless dungeon to divine the magic of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must make haste now.\u201d Nate patted her shoulder. \u201cThe castle guards will seek you out come morning.\u201d He turned to the soldier. \u201cI shall not forget this kindness, captain.\u201d</p><p>The light of their gems mingled as Nate returned the soldier\u2019s bow.</p><p>\u201cPrince Nathan, you will be a great king to usher in a bright future for our kingdom. You are by no means alone in your belief that our world must evolve to embrace all peoples,\u201d the soldier said with a brisk nod in Abby\u2019s direction.</p><p>Nate watched Abby as he answered, \u201cOne day our lands of light and darkness will be united.\u201d</p><p>And maybe Abby\u2019s lost sojourn had been in a worthy cause. Nate, the future king of Gemland, would honor her people and the good magic of their dreams.</p><p>Nate drew a yellowed map from the pocket of his purple cloak. \u201cNow, Abby of Underland, let the beacons of your glowing eyes and my gem\u2019s light guide our steps.\u201d He turned and, just like in Abby\u2019s dream, pointed to a path that meandered into the forest. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find your way home.\u201d</p><p>Abby, whose eyes cast a vivid glow into the forest, skipped with joy onto the path. Nate trailed her, laughing out loud.</p><p>\u201cAah, Prince,\u201d she spun around to exclaim, \u201cyour laughter is a delightful stream trickling through a happy garden!\u201d</p><p>That happy garden was Abby\u2019s heart, which thumped with joy. She was going home.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE END</p>"}
