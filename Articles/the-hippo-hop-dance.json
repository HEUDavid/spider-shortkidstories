Then we heard the sound, Oh that beat, to a great, great song.</p><p>It was the day of the Hippo Hop Dance, That we learned comes once a year. And no matter who they were, They just knew, that they had to be there.</p><p>Hippos were everywhere; they were jumping, They were moving their feet. They threw their hands, up in the air, Just grooving to the beat!</p><p>That safari turned out to be, Much more than we could hope. It\u2019s not often, that one sees, Hippos dancing and jumping rope.</p><p>People ask, where\u2019s the photos? For a tradition so long and proud. And I am quick, to let them know, That no cameras were allowed.</p>"}
