They dipped the bubble wands into their bucket and together they started to slowly blow a bubble.</p><p>\u2018Wow, this is definitely going to be the biggest bubble yet that we\u2019ll do,\u2019 Ava chuckled.</p><p>Suddenly a big gust of wind came and they watched as the bubble started to get bigger and bigger.\u00a0 It blew towards them and next thing they were inside it!</p><p>\u2018Oh this is so funny,\u2019 Se\u00e1n laughed as he tumbled around.</p><p>The bubble then began to float up and up in the air.\u00a0 It slowly went above the houses and over the hills and up towards the clouds.</p><p>\u2018Everything looks so tiny from up here,\u2019 Ava gasped.</p><p>\u2018Hey Ava, look down there,\u2019 Se\u00e1n yelled as he pointed down.</p><p>Below there was a big grey castle and lots and lots of bubbles around it.</p><p>\u2018Come on Ava, let\u2019s make our way down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But how can we do that?\u2019 she replied.</p><p>\u2018Watch me,\u2019 Se\u00e1n giggled. He puffed his cheeks out as much as he could and bent his head down and blew out a large breath.</p><p>\u2018Good thinking Se\u00e1n,\u2019 said Ava as she began to do the same.</p><p>After much huffing and puffing, the bubble began to descend and made its way down towards the castle.</p><p>\u2018Look at all those bubbles,\u2019 cried Ava \u2018and why is everything so grey looking?\u2019</p><p>Just then they heard voices calling out \u2018Help, Help!\u2019</p><p>In front of them, they saw it was a\u00a0\u00a0 king and queen inside a big bubble.</p><p>\u2018Oh, we\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here in Gubble Bubble Land,\u2019 cheered the king.\u00a0 \u2018The silly jester has messed up with bubbles again now and we are trapped inside.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But how did he do that?\u2019 asked Ava.</p><p>\u2018He decided to give the kingdom a good clean, so he filled a bubble bottle from the Ho-Hum River and covered the entire kingdom with its bubbles.\u00a0 But as you can see, not only did it clean everything it also took the colours away from the kingdom.\u00a0 And he thought he was doing us a favour by putting us into this bubble.\u00a0 Sure it\u2019s from the Ho-Hum River and he should have known we can\u2019t get out as that\u2019s from another kingdom!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 interrupted the queen \u2018Now he is ruling the entire kingdom, and as a result it has made everyone silly. We need to stop him before he causes any more damage.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is there anything we can do to help?\u2019 asked Se\u00e1n.</p><p>\u2018There is one thing,\u2019 the queen said frantically. \u2018First you will need to go the blue, yellow and red rivers beside the Rainbow Mountain. At the foot of the mountain you will find a bottle shaped like a Trident.\u00a0 You then need to fill that with water from each of the rivers.\u00a0 After you do that, you go to the top of the mountain, and blow the largest bubble you can.\u00a0 But hurry; there is not much time as the rivers only fill up for a short time when there is a full moon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ok, we will be as quick as we can,\u2019 said Ava \u2018Come on Se\u00e1n, we can do this.\u2019</p><p>Se\u00e1n and Ava jumped back into their bubble and quickly started to float over the kingdom.\u00a0 They saw that it was indeed chaos.</p><p>People were acting very silly. Some were eating breakfast from their hats. Others were wearing bowls on their head.\u00a0 Jester was making silly faces and dancing around people as they walked.</p><p>\u2018Oh, we really need to hurry,\u2019 Se\u00e1n gasped.</p><p>They quickly floated and floated across the kingdom and over the mountains and up toward the clouds.</p><p>\u2018Look!\u2019 cried Ava as she pointed \u2018I can see the three rivers and there\u2019s the trident shape bottle at the foot of the mountain. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s blow this bubble down harder!\u2019</p><p>After much huffing and puffing they carefully landed the bubble down\u00a0\u00a0 as they did before. Ava jumped out and dashed over and grabbed the bottle.\u00a0 She raced over to each of the rivers and filled it up with water.</p><p>\u2018Great job, now let\u2019s make our way to the top of this mountain,\u2019 said Se\u00e1n as he began to blow his cheeks out and move the bubble.</p><p>They floated towards the top of the mountain as fast as they could. When they landed, they jumped out and joined hands together.\u00a0 They then made a circle with them and poured the bubble water through and together, they blew the biggest, most colourful bubble that was ever seen in the kingdom.</p><p>The bubble began to slowly float down toward the kingdom.\u00a0 When it got down it landed on top of the jesters head.</p><p>\u2018Ahh what\u2019s going on, I\u2019m soaking wet,\u2019 the jester shouted.</p><p>It then made a large popping sound and spilled all over the kingdom.\u00a0 Slowly the kingdom started to regain its colour.</p><p>The kingdom all looked up when they heard the loud noise and cheered \u2018hooray for Se\u00e1n and Ava!\u2019</p><p>Se\u00e1n and Ava floated down and landed in front of the king and queen.\u00a0 Just then the king and queen\u2019s bubble popped and they got out and walked over towards them.</p><p>When the jester saw this he thought \u2018Oops, I might be in a little bit of trouble here\u2019 and off he scurried through the crowds.</p><p>\u2018Thank you Se\u00e1n and Ava,\u2019 said the king.\u00a0 \u2018We can rule the kingdom again. Would you mind hanging on for a while and help us go find that silly jester?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh yes, we would be delighted,\u2019 they both replied.</p><p>From that day on the silly jester never blew a bubble again.</p>"}
