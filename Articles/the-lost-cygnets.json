They had gone.\u00a0\u201cWe will have to go and look for them, Cedric.\u201d</p><p>They swam along the lake until they met Malic, a mallard.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Ciggy and Zola?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he squawked, ruffling his green feathers, \u201care they lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, I hope they haven\u2019t gone to the big river, anything could happen to them.\u201d Sissy looked worried.</p><p>Freddy frog stretched out in the sun on the bank his green leathery skin sparkling.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Ziggy and Zola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he croaked, closing his big green eyes, \u201csorry I\u2019m, sleeping,\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not much help, she thought.\u00a0 They glided to the mouth of the river, which became muddy. Reeds and tall grasses covered the surface, nothing like their lake. Shoals of silvery fish darted this way and that, their mouths agape.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen two cygnets?\u201d they asked the fish.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they bubbled.</p><p>In the fields cows were munching on the grass.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen two cygnets?\u201d asked Sissy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d mooed Maisy, a big nosed black and white cow. \u201dI\u2019m too busy eating.\u201d</p><p>Sissy backed away not liking these big creatures.\u00a0 \u201cCedric what shall we do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He hissed quietly trying to calm her.</p><p>They saw some sheep in the field.\u00a0 \u201cHave you seen some cygnets?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, baa, we haven\u2019t,\u201d they replied.</p><p>A big black horse slurped noisily at the river bank.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen two cygnets?\u201d asked Sissy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he neighed, shaking his head spraying water everywhere.\u00a0 \u201cThey went that way,\u201d he said, as he pointed his hoof along the river.</p><p>\u201cThere are some humans throwing bread, Sissy,\u201d said Cedric.</p><p>\u201cShall we feed the swans mum?\u201d asked \u00a0Tommy, one of the humans by the bank.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, they look fierce,\u201d \u00a0replied another human.</p><p>Sissy and Cedric gobbled hungrily, scattering the ducks.</p><p>A family of black moorhens with red beaks came to get a look in squeaking noisily.\u00a0 The swans swam further on until they came to a boathouse with fishermen; they gave them a wide berth, not wanting to get hooked in their lines.</p><p>\u201cLook Cedric, it must be the leaping salmon,\u201d said Sissy.</p><p>The waterfall crashed loudly near to them, green and pink silvery fish were leaping over it. Their shiny bodies glinted in the sun.</p><p>\u201cOh dear I hope they haven\u2019t gone over,\u201d cried Sissy.</p><p>It was getting dusk now; the sun going down, cast a red glow on the water.</p><p>Ahead they saw a flash of grey and on the bank were two lads throwing stones at something.\u00a0 Sissy saw it was Ziggy and Zola, two very frightened little cygnets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach those two boys a lesson,\u201d she hissed, fluming her wings and rushed up the bank menacingly.\u00a0 The boys took one look and ran for their lives with Sissy on their heels.</p><p>\u201cCome on, they won\u2019t come back,\u201d Cedric told the naughty cygnets.\u00a0 They climbed on his back and made their\u00a0way back to the lake.</p><p>They were soon fast asleep worn out by the adventure.</p>"}
