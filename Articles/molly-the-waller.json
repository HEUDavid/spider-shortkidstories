She worked at a pace, that suited her best. Building a wall, in her cap and pink vest.</p><p>From the time she was young, just a wee lass, she would gather up stones from the trail and the pass. She studied, then placed them, with a long line of string. One stone at a time, as she\u2019d whistle and sing.</p><p>No matter the day, from spring until fall, she found herself happy just building a wall.</p><p>She had tried other things that other folk do. Like woodwork, and painting, and fixing a roof. Was a cabby, a plumber, and once\u2026 was a cop! But she found it too busy, and told herself\u2026 \u201cStop!</p><p>Go back to the thing that you love to do best. Just building a wall, in your cap and pink vest.\u201d</p><p>And then one day\u2026</p><p>Along came the beaver, and he asked for her help. \u201cI am building a wall, not just for myself. But for all the good creatures, like trout and the frog. For the birds in the sky. I can start with a log. And if you can put stones, well then soon enough stands, not just any wall, but a strong mighty dam!\u201d</p><p>Together they worked by the stream all alone, With the downing of tree, and the stacking of stone. \u201cMany thanks!\u201d Said the Beaver. \u201cTill the end it will be. For the good of all critters. Just wait till they see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d said Molly. \u201cIt is what I do best.\u201d \u201cI love building a wall, in my cap and pink vest.\u201d</p><p>And then one day\u2026</p><p>Along came the preacher, the teacher, and then, the farmer, the fireman, the gravedigger and\u2026 They needed a Waller, with skill and with\u00a0haste. They all wanted Molly, to border their space.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a holiday first.\u201d Then a wedding with Desmond, and when they returned. They worked close together at what they did best, but with six little helpers, in a cap and pink vest.</p>"}
