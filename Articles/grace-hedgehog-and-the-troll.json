Jinsi looked a little happier now that Grace was going to help her.</p><p>Hedgehog lived alone in an old, tumbledown house at the end of\u00a0Saltwater Lane.\u00a0 Grace rapped loudly on the rusty door knocker and waited, but Hedgehog didn\u2019t seem to be at home.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk around the back,\u201d suggested Grace \u201cand see if he\u2019s in the garden.\u201d</p><p>Peering through a gap in the fence, the pair could clearly see Hedgehog,\u00a0busy with something in his greenhouse. Jinsi managed to attract his attention by tapping on the roof of the greenhouse with a long stick and before long they were seated before a roaring fire in the comfort of Hedgehog\u2019s rather cluttered kitchen, listening to his tale of woe.</p><p>Apparently, Hedgehog had been awakened in the middle of the night by\u00a0a loud crashing noise coming from the direction of his back garden.\u00a0 Quickly throwing on his dressing gown and slipping on his sandals, he had hurried down the stairs, picking up his large, heavy duty torch from the sideboard drawer as he went.\u00a0 Slowly opening the backdoor, Hedgehog had swept the beam of the torch across the garden but could see nothing amiss.\u00a0 Walking up to his greenhouse however, he had been shocked to discover that the door had been torn off its hinges and smashed to pieces.\u00a0 Even worse was the fact that every one of his prize pumpkins together with his fine crop of tomatoes had been stolen.</p><p>\u201cWhoever it was must have climbed over the fence,\u201d muttered Hedgehog ruefully, \u201cas I never forget to lock my garden gate.\u201d</p><p>Grace and Jinsi told Hedgehog of the strange disappearance of Dave and their intentions of venturing into Tinderbox wood to look for him.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to lock my front windows,\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog, \u201cand I\u2019ll come with you, although I will have to be home no later than four o\u2019clock as my brother Groucho is coming round for tea.\u00a0 I had hoped to make him a pumpkin pie but I suppose that is now definitely off the menu.\u201d</p><p>Grace, Jinsi and Hedgehog climbed over the old stile at the end of the lane and found themselves on the well tended, cobblestone path that wound its way down to the entrance of Tinderbox wood.\u00a0 The sun had disappeared behind a huge grey cloud and Hedgehog claimed he could\u00a0smell rain in the air.</p><p>\u201cAre we simply going to wander through the wood, calling out Dave\u2019s name?\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog, \u201cor do we have some kind of plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d muttered Jinsi, \u201cI know that he always used to enjoy walking down to the old stone bridge on occasion where he would partake in a little fishing so I suppose that would be as good a place as any to start.\u201d</p><p>The three friends stood in silence on the threshold of the wood.\u00a0 With the disappearance of the sun, the trees appeared dark and menacing.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d shouted Grace,\u201d we\u2019ll not find Dave dithering like this,\u201d and with those words, they plunged resolutely into the gloom and the search was on.</p><p>Once inside the wood, the air immediately became damp and musty.\u00a0It had, as Hedgehog had predicted, begun to rain but the dense foliage of the trees prevented the three of them from getting wet.\u00a0 Jinsi led the way followed closely by Grace with Hedgehog a few paces behind.</p><p>They had only been walking for ten minutes or more when Grace noticed something protruding from a patch of thistles beneath the bowl of an old, knotted oak tree.\u00a0 Crouching down, being careful not to sting her fingers, she gingerly extracted what appeared to be a metal brooch from the undergrowth.\u00a0 Looking over Grace\u2019s shoulder, Jinsi gave out a cry of\u00a0anguish.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dave\u2019s,\u201d sobbed Jinsi, \u201cI gave it to him as a birthday present last summer and he claimed that he would always wear it with pride. Oh what can this all mean?\u00a0 I just know that he wouldn\u2019t have cast it aside\u00a0without good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be too hasty here,\u201d counselled Hedgehog, flashing a cryptic smile at Grace.\u00a0 \u201cHow do we not know that Dave didn\u2019t drop this treasure on purpose as a sign that he is safe and well in the hope that it would be found by his friends who would surely come looking for him?\u201d</p><p>Grace placed a comforting arm around Jinsi.\u00a0 \u201cCome on Jinsi, we can\u2019t give up now.\u00a0 I think Hedgehog is right. All we need to do is head in the direction we are walking and I feel sure we will be lucky.\u201d</p><p>With a loud sniffle, Jinsi wiped away her tears and climbed unsteadily to her feet.\u00a0 Taking the brooch from Graces fingers, she dropped it into her canvas shoulder bag and with a shuddering sigh, proceeded to follow the meandering path that was clearly beginning to descend into the river valley.</p><p>Before long, the narrow track that the three friends had been following disappeared completely, leaving them in a quandary as to which route to take.\u00a0 The babble of a fast flowing stream could be heard quite clearly.</p><p>\u201cWell now!\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog, \u201cI suppose that we will have to cross the stream at some point.\u00a0 As we haven\u2019t been able to locate the bridge as of yet, might I suggest that we find a way to cross now.\u00a0 Once we are on the other side, we should be able to pick up the path again.\u201d</p><p>Jinsi had hardly spoken a word in the past twenty minutes.\u00a0 She had recently tripped over an out-stretched tree root and grazed her knee, an incident which hadn\u2019t exactly improved her current state of mind.\u00a0Carefully clambering down a steep embankment, the trio were confronted by a stretch of fast flowing water with no visible means of crossing.</p><p>\u201cThis way!\u201d shouted Grace, \u201cI can see a fallen log which should serve as a make-shift bridge.\u201d</p><p>Leading the way, Grace picked a route through the shallow waters of the stream until they eventually reached the log.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going first?\u201d stammered Hedgehog, \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be OK,\u201d laughed Grace.\u201d Just follow me and don\u2019t look down.\u201d</p><p>With a little puffing and grumbling from Hedgehog who had crossed last,\u00a0the three friends stood on the opposite bank.\u00a0 A series of paths lay before them but Jinsi, unexpectedly breaking her silence, claimed that they should follow the course of the river until they reach the bridge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it can\u2019t be far away,\u201d muttered Jinsi.\u00a0 \u201cDave brought me down here once, a long time ago but things seem to be much more overgrown since then.\u201d</p><p>The path along the edge of the stream proved to be rather slippery in places with both Jinsi and Hedgehog losing their footing and finding themselves ankle deep in water on more than one occasion. After edging their way along a particularly treacherous expanse of track, Grace looked up and gave a cry of delight.</p><p>\u201c Look! There it is!\u201d</p><p>Through the overhanging branches could be seen the moss covered stonework of an old bridge.\u00a0 The stream around the bridge itself appeared much wider, almost as if the water had been dammed at some point.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d uttered Jinsi, \u201cstepping onto the structure, \u201cthis is one spot that certainly hasn\u2019t changed at all since my last visit.\u201d\u00a0Crouching down she mysteriously began to scan the stonework of the bridge wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d inquired Hedgehog.</p><p>\u201cOn our one and only visit together, Dave and I scratched our initials into one of the stones and I just wanted to see if I could still find them.\u201d</p><p>Grace and Hedgehog immediately joined in the search.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve found them!\u201d cried Hedgehog moments later. \u201cJ + D = X, but what do you make of this below.\u201d</p><p>Scratched in the stone directly underneath were the freshly inscribed words :-\u00a0 HELP AM TAKEN.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest we do now Hedgehog?\u201d enquired Grace.</p><p>Tears had begun to well up in Jinsi\u2019s eyes once again as she stared, transfixed at the mysterious message.\u00a0 Hedgehog scratched his head and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt whatsoever that this was written by Dave.\u00a0 The question is who or indeed what has taken him and most important of all, where has he been taken to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just can\u2019t go home and leave Dave to his fate,\u201d stammered Jinsi.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to keep searching don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Grace and Hedgehog exchanged worried glances and remained silent.\u00a0Just then, Hedgehog, whose sense of hearing was much keener than the others, cupped a paw to his ear.</p><p>\u201cListen, do you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Both Jinsi and Grace listened intently but could hear nothing.\u00a0 Suddenly, Grace gave out a cry.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u00a0 I hear it.\u00a0 It sounds like some kind of drum beat to me.\u00a0 Do you hear it Jinsi?\u201d</p><p>But Jinsi was lost in her own world of misery and didn\u2019t even hear Grace\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog, \u201cas this sound is the only lead we have to go on, I suppose that we must follow it.\u201d</p><p>With these words, the three companions set off in the direction of the rhythmic beat which, much to Graces fear\u2019s, led them deeper into the heart of the wood.</p><p>They had been walking for a half hour or more on a gradual incline as they painstakingly climbed their way out of the river valley.\u00a0 Hedgehog was beginning to lag behind, forcing Grace and Jinsi to make innumerable halts in order for him to catch up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as nimble as I used to be,\u201d puffed Hedgehog, as he collapsed onto an old tree stump, sweating profusely.</p><p>Grace delved into her little back pack that she never went anywhere without and withdrew two small bottles of water.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d offered Grace, \u201cthis should refresh you a little.\u201d</p><p>Hedgehog eagerly accepted the drink which he consumed in four large gulps while Grace shared the other bottle with Jinsi.\u00a0 The drum beats appeared noticeably nearer but still, by Hedgehogs estimation, at least a good half hours walk away.\u00a0 Grace was becoming increasingly agitated as she had never been this far into the wood.\u00a0 They had scaled \u201cBluebell Hill\u201d an hour ago, a landmark which Grace had been distinctly told by her mummy not to venture beyond.\u00a0 The ground was thankfully beginning to level out, enabling Hedgehog to close up on Grace and Jinsi.\u00a0 They had just discovered a path which seemed to have been made much more recently than the others which led in the general direction of the sound when the drum beats abruptly ceased.</p><p>\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d moaned Jinsi.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need them any more!\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog.\u00a0 \u201cLook over there!\u201d</p><p>Out of the thick tangle of trees that lay ahead, a brown pall of smoke drifted lazily into the air.</p><p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d whispered Hedgehog.\u00a0 \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, our quest is almost over.\u201d</p><p>The going had certainly become much easier since they had climbed out of the valley.\u00a0 The air had become a lot fresher and what\u2019s more, it had obviously stopped raining as bands of sunlight could be seen slanting their way through the tree tops.\u00a0 As they drew ever nearer to the source of the smoke, Hedgehog suddenly called a halt.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be wise if I did a little scouting on my own first, just to see if there is any immediate danger ahead.\u00a0 Wait for me here and I shouldn\u2019t be more than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you get caught or fall into a trap,\u201d protested Grace, \u201cwhatever would we do then?\u201d</p><p>Hedgehog gave out a low chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me.\u00a0 I have experienced this kind of escapade before when I was much younger.\u00a0Some things I guess you just never forget.\u201d</p><p>With those words, Hedgehog turned and set off in the direction of the rising smoke, leaving Grace and Jinsi huddled together for comfort.</p><p>Time ticked slowly by.\u00a0 Five minutes turned into ten minutes. Ten minutes into fifteen. Still no sign of Hedgehog.\u00a0 Just as Grace was about to suggest walking a little in the direction that Hedgehog had taken, there was a loud crack in the undergrowth nearby as if someone had stepped on a very large branch.\u00a0 Another crackle, equally as loud followed moments later. Grace couldn\u2019t help but smile as relief washed over her face.</p><p>\u201cHedgehog!\u201d she cried, \u201cfor someone that has done this kind of thing before, you certainly make a lot of noise.\u201d</p><p>Sauntering over to the clearing from where the disturbance was issuing, Grace and Jinsi peeped out from behind an ivy festooned tree trunk expecting to see Hedgehog.\u00a0 What they saw instead was a large, misshapen creature with long, hairy arms, one of which hung almost down to the ground.\u00a0 Underneath the other arm was wedged a huge bundle of sticks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the troll,\u201d hissed Grace, dodging back behind the tree. \u201cStay as quiet as you can.\u201d</p><p>Jinsi, who had herself only caught a brief glimpse, was nevertheless trembling uncontrollably.\u00a0 The troll\u2019s monstrous head moved slowly from side to side as it tried to work out exactly where the voice had come from.\u00a0 Grace and Jinsi carefully began to inch their way back to where they had been seated.\u00a0 Just then, Hedgehog emerged through the bushes.\u00a0 Before he had time to speak however, Grace placed a finger to her lips and pointed in the direction of the clearing. \u00a0Hedgehog nodded slowly and with a wave of his paw, beckoned the pair to follow him.\u00a0 When they had reached a safe enough distance, Grace and Jinsi sat down on a patch of matted grass and listened intently to what Hedgehog had to say.</p><p>After leaving Grace and Jinsi concealed in the undergrowth, Hedgehog had continued along a crude but nevertheless, well tended pathway,\u00a0pausing frequently in order to listen for any tell-tale sounds of activity.</p><p>The smoke had begun to diminish considerably and, just as Hedgehog was beginning to fear that he had lost his second guide, he had forced a passage through a dense wall of intermingled shrubbery and found himself in a beautiful, sun-drenched glade. With the intense brightness in comparison with the gloominess of the wood forcing him to shield his eyes, Hedgehog gazed in wonder at the scene that lay before him.</p><p>The path that he had temporarily abandoned for fear of being spotted by who or whatever dwelt in this neck of the woods, continued up to an old, weather-beaten gate, the hinges of which were almost completely rusted away.\u00a0 Either side of the path however grew the most dazzling array of flowers that Hedgehog had ever seen. Considering himself somewhat of a horticulturist, his sharp eyes detected at least four types of bloom the like of which he had never seen before in his life.\u00a0 Beyond the gate, lay a picturesque little lawn, again framed by sizable clumps of multi-coloured flowers.\u00a0 Hedgehog suddenly found himself beginning to relax his vigilance.\u00a0 Surely, anybody that could grow such magnificent plants as these must be some kind of genius. Then his gaze fell on what could only vaguely be described as a house.\u00a0 The comparison between the splendid garden and the ramshackle hovel that lay before him was nothing short of astounding.\u00a0 From where Hedgehog stood, two solitary windows could be seen, both of which had been boarded up with hefty planks of wood. Lengths of twisted guttering hung forlornly from the flaking facia boards and a huge, gaping hole in the roof was partly covered by an expanse of greasy tarpaulin.\u00a0\u00a0 The smoke which had guided them to this very location was issuing from a stumpy pipe which protruded out of the roof at a jaunty angle.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d pondered Hedgehog, \u201can expert gardener without a doubt, but definitely a non-starter with the DIY.\u201d</p><p>Passing through the old gate, Hedgehog, observed what looked like a corroded bath tub perched bottom uppermost over two pieces of wood.\u00a0 Beside it lay an enormous wooden serving spoon.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d muttered Hedgehog to himself, \u201cthe source of the drum beats perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Continuing around the back of the house, Hedgehog\u2019s wariness immediately began to re-assert itself.\u00a0 Four large, cast-iron cauldrons\u00a0dominated the relatively small enclosure, one of which sat atop a sizable pile of twigs and straw.\u00a0 Tentatively peering over the rim of the pot, Hedgehog could discern a number of all too familiar objects floating around in the water.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d growled Hedgehog, \u201cat least I now know where the thief lives. I\u2019d recognise those pumpkins anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Opening the neck of a hessian sack that hung precariously from a hook in the wall, he gingerly inserted a paw and low and behold, withdrew one of his prize winning tomatoes.\u00a0 Hedgehog by now was really beginning to seethe with anger.\u00a0 A sharp tapping sound however abruptly distracted him from his annoyance.\u00a0 Turning sharply, he noticed movement from a window which, unlike the front ones, had not been boarded up but had ominously been fitted with four sturdy looking iron bars.\u00a0 Slowly moving across, Hedgehog could just make out a grubby hand through the thick film of dust that was caked over the window pane.\u00a0 Taking out a paisley handkerchief from his dungaree pocket, he scrubbed furiously at the glass and within a matter of seconds was staring at the forlorn face of Dave.\u00a0 Hedgehogs first inclination was to simply smash the glass, see if he could dislodge any of the metal bars, haul Dave out to freedom and make a run for it, but his ever cautious mind told him to gather the details of Dave\u2019s apparent imprisonment first.</p><p>He had already checked the solitary door of the house at the front and discovered it not surprisingly to be locked.\u00a0 He next attempted to converse with Dave but without success.\u00a0 Either the particular room that he was confined in had been sound proofed, or Dave was so weak and emaciated that he simply couldn\u2019t make himself heard.\u00a0 After suddenly realising that he had been shouting for the last few minutes in his efforts\u00a0to communicate, Hedgehog abandoned this course of action, not wishing to attract unwanted attention. Just as he was about to wander off in search of another means of access, Dave, with his finger, began to\u00a0scrawl on the dust covered glass that he could just reach between the bars of his cell window. The procedure was painstakingly tedious as, of course, Dave had to write backwards for Hedgehog to be able to read it.\u00a0 Before too long however, the message was complete and read as follows :-.</p><p>NO TIME TO LOSE.\u00a0 A MEAL IS BEING PREPARED AND I AM ON THE MENU.\u00a0 AM CHAINED TO THE WALL. CAN SEE KEY TO OPEN LOCK BUT CANNOT REACH.\u00a0 DO YOUR BEST DEAR FRIEND.</p><p>Hedgehog thoughtfully scratched an ear.\u00a0 Assistance was definitely called for, without a shadow of doubt.\u00a0 He had already formed a plan in his head but, as Dave had stated in his message, time was most certainly of the essence. Imitating Dave, Hedgehog moistened one of his claws and quickly scratched in the corner :-</p><p>WILL BE BACK SOON WITH HELP.</p><p>The only information Hedgehog would supply Grace and Jinsi with on his return was that he had found Dave and that they needed to hurry in order to rescue him. Grace quickly told Hedgehog about the troll and without further ado, the three companions set off at a brisk pace, following the path directly to the house.\u00a0 On arrival, Jinsi pleaded with Hedgehog to permit her to see Dave which, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he reluctantly allowed.</p><p>\u201cStay with him at the window,\u201d he instructed, \u201cand we\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you with heights?\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog turning to Grace. \u201cYou seemed pretty confident crossing that log back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m OK with it,\u201d replied Grace, \u201cjust tell me what you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>Hedgehog quickly explained that he intended to lower Grace through the hole in the roof, using a length of what looked like washing line that he had discovered coiled up underneath one of the cooking pots around the back.\u00a0 The rest, once she had gained access, would be up to her.</p><p>\u201cNo pressure then,\u201d mumbled Grace,\u00a0 \u201cOK, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Cupping his paws together for a foothold, Hedgehog easily boosted Grace up onto the roof.\u00a0 He next tightly secured one end of the line around a sturdy beech tree and handed the other end to Grace.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get up to the hole, you may have to peel back some of the tarp to get through.\u00a0 If it\u2019s anything like the rest of this place you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded determinedly and proceeded to clamber up the roof.\u00a0 It took her five minutes to reach the hole, her passage being hindered by loose tiles that became dislodged at the slightest touch.\u00a0 Eventually arriving at her destination, she discovered that yet again, Hedgehog was correct.\u00a0 One corner of the tarpaulin was completely unattached and Grace had no difficulty whatsoever in folding it back.\u00a0 Dropping the rope into the darkness below, she inhaled deeply and carefully lowered herself into the entrance of the hole.</p><p>\u201cHere goes,\u201d she mumbled to herself and began to inch her way down the cord.</p><p>Hedgehog meanwhile, having observed Grace disappear from view,\u00a0was just about to check on Jinsi when, to his abject horror he spotted in the far distance the dark figure of what had to be the troll, loping along the pathway at an alarming rate.\u00a0 On its shoulders was perched a huge bundle of sticks and Hedgehogs sharp ears could even make out a kind of tuneless chant that it was mouthing.\u00a0 Quickly darting behind the house, he whisked up Jinsi who, with her face pressed to the glass, had been attempting to talk to Dave and plunged into the underbrush that covered one corner of the enclosure.</p><p>\u201cWell Jinsi,\u201d stammered Hedgehog almost close to tears, \u201cthere\u2019s\u00a0 nothing we can do now.\u00a0 It\u2019s all down to Grace I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to Grace as though she had been dangling on the cord for an eternity when her feet finally came to rest on the floor.\u00a0 The first thing that she noticed about the interior was the disgusting smell which, mingled with the smell of smoke from the dying embers of a fire seemed to be a mixture of urine, rotten eggs and smelly socks.\u00a0 It was, as a result of the front windows being bordered up, extremely dark in the section of house she had landed in.\u00a0 Undeterred, she removed her trusty backpack and fumbling around inside, withdrew her little pocket torch.\u00a0 Flipping on the switch, she silently cursed herself for not renewing the batteries as all that issued from the torch was a feeble band of light.</p><p>It was enough however for Grace to get her bearings.\u00a0 She had been reliably informed by Hedgehog that Dave was imprisoned at the rear of the house and began to head therefore in a direction leading away from the \u00a0windows.</p><p>She appeared to be travelling down some type of corridor that Grace could now see terminated in front of two large doors.\u00a0 The light was definitely improving as she approached the two portals.\u00a0 Walking along, Grace found herself becoming increasingly irritated by the carpet of what seemed like splintery wooden sticks that she was compelled to stumble over.\u00a0 Stooping down to pick one up, the blood literally froze in her veins as she found herself staring at a large, unquestionably human bone.</p><p>\u201cOh Jeepers!\u201d wailed Grace to herself, \u201cjust let me get the job done and get out of this awful place.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, out of the gloom Grace heard a muffled voice that just had to be Dave\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDave!\u201d yelled Grace, \u201cwhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight hand door of the two doors facing you!\u201d came the frantic reply.</p><p>Grace burst through the door with all her might and was confronted by Dave looking dirty and dishevelled, manacled to a large iron spike jutting out of the wall.</p><p>\u201cAre you a sight for sore eyes!\u201d exclaimed Dave. \u201cMake haste Grace, the key is over there next to that strongbox.\u00a0 The troll has been gone for some time now and could be back at any minute.\u201d</p><p>Almost in answer to Dave\u2019s warning, the pair heard the rattle of a key in the front door lock.</p><p>\u201cQuick Grace!\u201d pleaded Dave, \u201cget these chains off me then at least we\u2019ll stand a fighting chance.\u201d</p><p>With trembling hands, Grace somehow managed to insert the key in the lock and turn it.\u00a0 The chains fell to the floor with a clatter and grabbing hold of Grace\u2019s wrist, Dave hauled her through the cell door and headed for the shadows in the furthest recesses of the corridor.</p><p>Standing at his garden gate, the troll sensed that something was amiss,\u00a0the most noticeable evidence being the length of rope that trailed down from the roof.\u00a0 Coupled with the fact that his tarpaulin had obviously been tampered with, even the troll\u2019s slow brain began to put two and two together.\u00a0 Fumbling in his pocket he withdrew a large bunch of keys, selected one and inserted it into the lock of his front door.</p><p>Stepping inside, he managed, after a few minutes of stumbling around in the dark, to locate a candle which he lit with a match extracted from a cupboard drawer.\u00a0 His eyes immediately fell on the rope that dangled down from above.\u00a0 With an almighty bellow, the troll charged down the corridor towards the room where he had earlier that morning secured his\u00a0evening meal.\u00a0 Arriving at the entrance to what he had lovingly christened the meat locker, his worst fears were realised.\u00a0 The chains that he had locked into place around his prisoner lay in a heap on the floor and the room was empty.\u00a0 The troll, letting out a blood-curdling roar, stomped angrily into the cell and in his rage, began to throw any loose object that he could lay his hands on against the wall.</p><p>Suddenly, from the shadows of the corridor Dave sprang out and with a cry of triumph, slammed the door of the cell shut.\u00a0 Grace swiftly handed Dave a length of lead pipe which she had discovered on the floor while they were waiting for the troll to make his move.\u00a0 Forcefully jamming the pipe between the door handle and the door frame, Dave took hold of Graces hand and the two friends scampered as fast as they could along the corridor, through the front door which fortunately the troll had left ajar and out into the blessed light of day.</p><p>\u201cThat ought to hold him for a while,\u201d gasped Dave grimly, \u201cat least long enough for us to be well clear of this place anyway.\u201d</p><p>The indescribable noise issuing from the house was enough to give wings to their feet. Sprinting through the garden gate, Grace spotted Hedgehog and Jinsi waiting for them at the edge of the clearing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201d yelled Dave at the top of his voice.\u00a0 \u201cHe might possibly break out at any moment and I personally don\u2019t wish to be around if he does.\u201d</p><p>The four companions plunged into the dense undergrowth of the wood and didn\u2019t slacken their pace until they had reached the river.\u00a0Hedgehog suggested that they took a few minutes breather at the old stone bridge.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d exclaimed Dave, \u201cthis is where I was captured.\u201d\u00a0 While the troll was busy trussing my feet, I just had time to scratch you that brief message before a bag was thrust over my head and I was hoisted onto his shoulders and transported to his lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been so scared,\u201d whispered Jinsi who had hardly let go of his hand since being re-united.</p><p>\u201cWell it certainly was no picnic in the park that\u2019s for sure,\u201d retorted Dave.</p><p>\u201cOh and by the way, what pray is the meaning of this?\u201d\u00a0 Jinsi dipped into her bag and withdrew the metal brooch that Grace had discovered at the base of the tree. \u201cSo much for treasured heirlooms!\u201d</p><p>Dave\u2019s face flushed red with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI honestly have no idea how I could have dropped it Jinsi.\u00a0 I certainly didn\u2019t intend to that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0 As things have turned out, it was possibly a stroke of luck that I did drop it as it set you all on the right track to finding me.\u201c</p><p>Dave\u2019s voice had trailed off lamely.\u00a0 Grace and Hedgehog exchanged\u00a0knowing looks but nothing more was spoken of the matter.</p><p>\u201cWhat I would like to learn,\u201d spoke Hedgehog \u201cis the meaning of the drum beats.\u00a0 Without them we most certainly wouldn\u2019t have had a clue as to which direction to head off in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d responded Dave, \u201cit is the troll\u2019s recognised form of jungle telegraph.\u00a0 Whenever a meal is in the offering, the message goes out as an invitation to any friends or relatives that are in the neighbourhood to come and dine.\u00a0 As there surely can\u2019t be that many troll families populating this fair planet of ours, I guess that most of the time he would have dined alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one tragic outcome to emerge from this adventure, for me at any rate,\u201d exclaimed Hedgehog \u201cis that I have lost the opportunity to study that excellent garden with all those rare and beautiful flowers.\u00a0 I think I could have written a book about some of the delights that abounded in that small patch of natural paradise and made myself a fortune.\u00a0 I still can\u2019t believe that such a god given gift could have been granted to a creature as revolting as that troll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was a way of luring unwary wanderers into a trap,\u201d spoke Grace,\u201d you know, like the spider and the fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyhow,\u201d concluded Dave, \u201cI can\u2019t thank you all enough for coming to rescue me.\u00a0 It\u2019s comforting to know that I am blessed with such caring and wonderful friends as you.\u201d</p><p>Hedgehog cast a glance at the sun which was sinking rapidly towards the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI think we had better make a move,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI know of some parents that will be very keen to know of their daughter\u2019s whereabouts at this late hour of the day.\u201d</p><p>With those words, the four companions rose to their feet as one and proceeded along the path that would lead them out of Tinderbox wood and back to the familiarities of a normal life.</p><p>Three days later, Hedgehog invited Grace, Dave and Jinsi around to his house for tea together with his brother Groucho and Green Man who had returned early from Harpers Ferry.\u00a0 As they all sat around the large mahogany table in Hedgehog\u2019s dining room tucking into stew and dumplings, Hedgehog loudly cleared his throat to gain attention.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose any one has read yesterdays local gazette,\u201d he announced in a sombre voice, I think there is something within its pages that might just interest you all.\u00a0 Placing the journal on the table for all to see, the headline ran as follows :-</p><p>FIRE RAGES THROUGH TINDERBOX WOOD</p><p>Grace picked up the paper and began to read out loud.</p><p>\u201cForest rangers and local volunteers have been battling flames on the northern most section of Tinderbox wood today. Large clouds of smoke had been spotted by staff of a nearby lumber yard who immediately contacted the necessary authorities.\u00a0 No one yet knows exactly what caused the fire but amid the devastation was discovered a derelict house which had been burnt to the ground.\u00a0 No bodies were discovered but inside information claims that the fire could possibly have started from the building.\u00a0 The fire is now under control but local police strongly discourage anyone from entering the wood for at least six weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh well,\u201d exclaimed Grace, \u201cI suppose that draws a veil over our little rescue mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of all those beautiful flowers,\u201d lamented Hedgehog, \u201call gone up in smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if the troll managed to escape before the fire took hold?\u201d mumbled Jinsi.\u00a0 \u201cAfter all, no body was found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to hope that he didn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Dave, \u201cor he could be paying you a visit at the dead of night the same as he did to Hedgehog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me to suggest that you all put the whole experience behind you now,\u201d suggested Green Man, who had been fully informed about the entire adventure, \u201cand may I propose a toast to the gallant band of rescuers, especially Grace who somehow managed to keep a cool head on her shoulders when it mattered the most.\u201d</p><p>Everyone chinked their glasses together and drained the contents.</p><p>\u201cAs a footnote to this affair,\u201d Green Man continued, \u201cmight I suggest to a certain somebody that the next time he decides to visit the corner shop for a bottle of milk.\u00a0 PLEASE TAKE A FRIEND WITH YOU!\u201d</p><p>Dave\u2019s face flushed crimson once again but as no one seemed to notice, he simply joined in with the gales of laughter that echoed loudly around the room.</p>"}
