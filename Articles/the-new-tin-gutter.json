See her go!\u201d Raggedy Andy cried.</p><p>All the other dolls climbed upon the window sill beside him.</p><p>\u201cScoot me too!\u201d cried the other little penny doll in her squeeky little voice, and Raggedy Andy took her in his rag hand and gave her a great swing which sent her scooting down the shiny tin gutter, \u201cKerswish!\u201d</p><p>Then Raggedy Andy climbed into the gutter himself and, taking a few steps, spread out his feet and went scooting down the shiny tin.</p><p>The other dolls followed his example and scooted along behind him.</p><p>When Raggedy Andy came to the place where he expected to find the penny dolls lying, they were nowhere about.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you scooted them farther than you thought!\u201d Uncle Clem said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I did!\u201d Raggedy Andy said, \u201cWe will look around the bend in the eave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear!\u201d he exclaimed when he had peeped around the corner of the roof, \u201cthe gutter ends here and there is nothing but a hole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have scooted right into the hole,\u201d Henny, the Dutch doll said.</p><p>Raggedy Andy lay flat upon the shiny tin and looked down into the hole.</p><p>\u201cAre you down there, penny dolls?\u201d he called.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cI hope their heads were not broken!\u201d Raggedy Ann said.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-048.jpg'></img><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I scooted them!\u201d Raggedy Andy cried, as he brushed his hand over his shoe button eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you hold to my feet, I can reach down the hole and find them and pull them up again!\u201d he added.</p><p>Uncle Clem and Henny each caught hold of a foot of Raggedy Andy and let him slide down into the hole.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-050.jpg'></img><p>It was a rather tight fit, but Raggedy Andy wiggled and twisted until all the dolls could see of him were his two feet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find them!\u201d he said in muffled tones. \u201cLet me down farther and I think I\u2019ll be able to reach them!\u201d</p><p>Now Henny and Uncle Clem thought that Raggedy Andy meant for them to let go of his feet and this they did.</p><p>Raggedy Andy kept wiggling and twisting until he came to a bend in the pipe and could go no farther.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find them!\u201d he cried. \u201cThey have gone farther down the pipe! Now you can pull me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t reach you, Raggedy Andy!\u201d Uncle Clem called down the pipe. \u201cTry to wiggle back up a piece and we will catch your feet and pull you up!\u201d</p><p>Raggedy Andy tried to wiggle backward up the pipe, but his clothes caught upon a little piece of tin which stuck out from the inside of the pipe and there he stayed. He could neither go down nor come back up.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d Uncle Clem cried, \u201cThe folks will never find him down there, for we can not tell them where he is, and they will never guess it!\u201d</p><p>The dolls were all very sad. They stayed out upon the shiny new tin gutter until it began raining and hoped and hoped that Raggedy Andy could get back up to them.</p><p>Then they went inside the nursery and sat looking out the window until it was time for the folks to get up and the house to be astir. Then they went back to the position each had been in, when Marcella had left them.</p><p>And although they were very quiet, each one was so sorry to lose Raggedy Andy, and each felt that he would never be found again.</p><p>\u201cThe rain must have soaked his cotton through and through!\u201d sighed Raggedy Ann. \u201cFor all the water from the house runs down the shiny tin gutters and down the pipe into a rain barrel at the bottom!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-052.jpg'></img><p>Then Raggedy Ann remembered that there was an opening at the bottom of the pipe.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night if we have a chance, we dolls must take a stick and see if we can reach Raggedy Andy from the bottom of the pipe and pull him down to us!\u201d she thought.</p><p>Marcella came up to the nursery and played all day, watching the rain patter upon the new tin gutter. She wondered where Raggedy Andy was, although she did not get worried about him until she had asked Mama where he might be.</p><p>\u201cHe must be just where you left him!\u201d Mama said.</p><p>\u201cI cannot remember where I left him!\u201d Marcella said.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was with all the other dolls in the nursery, though!\u201d</p><p>All day Sunday it rained and all of Sunday night, and Monday morning when Daddy started to work it was still raining.</p><p>As Daddy walked out of the front gate, he turned to wave good-bye to Mama and Marcella and then he saw something.</p><p>Daddy came right back into the house and called up the men who had put in the new shiny tin gutters.</p><p>\u201cThe drain pipe is plugged up. Some of you must have left shavings or something in the eaves, and it has washed down into the pipe, so that the water pours over the gutter in sheets!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will send a man right up to fix it!\u201d the men said.</p><p>So along about ten o\u2019clock that morning one of the men came to fix the pipe.</p><p>But although he punched a long pole down the pipe, and punched and punched, he could not dislodge whatever it was which plugged the pipe and kept the water from running through it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-053.jpg'></img><p>Then the man measured with his stick, so that he knew just where the place was, and with a pair of tin shears he cut a section from the pipe and found Raggedy Andy.</p><p>Raggedy Andy was punched quite out of shape and all jammed together, but when the man straightened out the funny little figure, Raggedy Andy looked up at him with his customary happy smile.</p><p>The man laughed and carried little water-soaked Raggedy Andy into the house.</p><p>\u201cI guess your little girl must have dropped this rag doll down into the drain pipe!\u201d the man said to Mama.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you found him!\u201d Mama said to the man.</p><p>\u201cWe have hunted all over the house for him! Marcella could not remember where she put him; so when I get him nice and dry, I\u2019ll hide him in a nice easy place for her to find, and she will not know he has been out in the rain all night!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-054.jpg'></img><p>So Mama put Raggedy Andy behind the radiator and there he sat all afternoon, steaming and drying out.</p><p>And as he sat there he smiled and smiled, even though there was no one to see him.</p><p>He felt very happy within and he liked to smile, anyway, because his smile was painted on.</p><p>And another reason Raggedy Andy smiled was because he was not lonesome.</p><p>Inside his waist were the two little penny dolls.</p><p>The man had punched Raggedy Andy farther down into the pipe, and he had been able to reach the two little dolls and tuck them into a safe place.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they all be surprised to see us back again!\u201d Raggedy Andy whispered as he patted the two little penny dolls with his soft rag hands.</p><p>And the two little penny dolls nestled against Raggedy Andy\u2019s soft cotton stuffed body, and thought how nice it was to have such a happy, sunny friend.</p>"}
