Not another soul was out and about. The rest of the world seemed to be cozy in their beds asleep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she found herself far out in the countryside.\u00a0 The moon was so bright that night she could clearly see all around her.\u00a0 Below her she spied dozens of sheep nestled together in clusters and a few cows were huddled under the bushes by one of the stone walls.\u00a0 Then a beam of light shone its brightest on him.\u00a0 He was tall, dark and four legged!\u00a0 He was the most beautiful horse Rosie had ever seen.\u00a0 He looked just like Black Beauty, one of her favourite book characters.\u00a0 It seemed that he was standing there under a sycamore tree just waiting for Rosie to ride him. \u00a0So she floated down just above the ground and tip-toed to a gentle landing several feet from him.\u00a0 She slowly began to walk toward the horse.</p><p>Rosie always, always wanted a horse.\u00a0 She lived in the city around the corner from the farmer\u2019s market where she could have bought hay for a horse, that is, if her mother would ever let her get one!\u00a0 And up the street there was even a blacksmith!\u00a0 Then to top it all off, didn\u2019t her back yard have cobblestones in it with stables that could hold three or more horses? \u00a0Her home was over two hundred years old.\u00a0 Someone had horses there years ago.\u00a0 Yet still her mother always said, \u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0 But now, here was her chance to ride this beautiful stallion.\u00a0 His shiny coat glistened in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cCan I get on your back?\u201d\u00a0 she softly said to him.\u00a0 Slowly reaching into the pocket of her pajamas she pulled out a hard sweet that was stuck in there from earlier.\u00a0 She placed it in the middle of her hand and \u2018Beauty\u2019 bent his neck down and tickled Rosie\u2019s palm with his lips as he took it from her.\u00a0 She gently patted his neck and stared into his beautiful big eyes as he crunched away.\u00a0 She could see the reflection of the moon staring back out at her.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t you move,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to get up on your back, so be a good horse for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>She took a hold of his mane and stretched her leg up as high as she could, but she slipped down to the ground.\u00a0 She tried once more but still she couldn\u2019t get up on him.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t as easy as she had thought.\u00a0 Then finally she did a running jump and wouldn\u2019t you know, third time lucky, she effortlessly flew up onto his back.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I do that the first time?\u201d she thought.\u00a0 She had forgotten she could fly.\u00a0 \u201cGiddy up there,\u201d Rosie said as she gripped his mane tightly with both hands.\u00a0 She tapped her bare feet against Beauty\u2019s belly a few times, trying to send him the message that she wanted him to move.\u00a0 Beauty walked off slowly at first, and then gradually went into a trot.\u00a0 Rosie was so proud of herself for doing so well.\u00a0 With the wind at her back, her long black hair kept blowing onto her face preventing her from seeing where she was going.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t care!\u00a0 She was feeling so free now.\u00a0 She trusted the horse knew where he was going.</p><p>Rosie was beaming from ear to ear.\u00a0 This was turning out to be the most exciting night of her life.\u00a0 The horse began to canter across the field.\u00a0 Before long the horse went into a gallop scattering a flock of sheep sending them in all directions.</p><p>Suddenly out of nowhere, a stone wall appeared in front of them. \u00a0All she could do now was close her eyes tight and grip on for dear life.\u00a0 She felt her stomach quickly rise as Beauty sailed over the wall.\u00a0 Then her stomach sank with a thud as they landed.\u00a0 \u201cPhew that was close,\u201d she said then inhaled deeply. She opened her eyes and found herself laying half way up the neck of the horse with her arms wrapped tightly around him.</p><p>Rosie then became aware of a sign in front of her said in big capital letters, NO TRESSPASSING ALLOWED.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOH NO! That\u2019s not good,\u201d she cried! \u201cI better get out of here quickly!\u201d\u00a0 Rosie bent down and kissed Beauty on the neck.\u00a0 \u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough of an adventure for one night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a million for letting me ride you, Beauty,\u201d Rosie said as she slapped him fondly on the side of his neck.\u00a0 She wished she could take him home with her. \u201cGood bye, Beauty I have to go now.\u201d Rosie stared into his eyes once more.\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019ll never forget you!\u201d</p><p>Rosie hoped the magic would work again to get her home.\u00a0 Being hopeful she turned and ran with her arms outstretched to the center of the field and it only took a few steps before she lifted off the ground and was once more soaring high above the trees.\u00a0 She was afraid to wave to her friend below in case she wobbled a bit and would lose her balance.\u00a0 It was wonderful to be able to fly but she didn\u2019t want to fall to the ground. Rosie circled around once then headed back towards the city lights.</p><p>She was so wrapped up in the magic of the evening that she forgot to pay attention to where she was going.\u00a0 Beginning to feel scared she realized she had flown way past the city center, so she turned around and came back down a few more streets until she saw the clock tower that was just one street over from hers.\u00a0 It was so nice to see her home come into view. Rosie was soon back home and flew in her open window which was on the third floor.\u00a0 She landed softly on top of her bed.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t go to sleep just yet, so she went over to the window sill and picked her book up off the floor.\u00a0 It had been left there when she flew out the window earlier.\u00a0 She sat for a minute on the window sill just staring up at the man in the moon. She gave him a big wink.</p><p>\u201cDo I have you to thank for my big adventure this evening?\u201d she smiled. Rosie couldn\u2019t believe she just flew around out there in the night sky.\u00a0 She hopped back on her bed and dove under the covers with her book.\u00a0 She never got to read a single word and fell fast asleep.</p><p>When Rosie woke up the next morning her thoughts went immediately to the night before.\u00a0 \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been a dream; it just had to have been real.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 She jumped out of bed and threw on some jeans and a shirt then ran downstairs two at a time to have her breakfast.</p><p>Rosie found herself smiling as she ate her porridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you this morning?\u201d her mother asked.\u00a0 \u201cYou usually are making all sorts of nasty looking faces while you eat your oatmeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just thinking I\u2019d love to go horseback riding sometime!\u201d Rosie replied.</p><p>\u201cOh you were now were you?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Rosie\u2019s mother said as she peered over the top of her reading glasses. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to hear you asking me for a horse again this morning or ever again for that matter, but if its lessons you want, we\u2019ll see!\u201d</p><p>Her mother went back to reading the morning paper.\u00a0 She turned page after page until she suddenly said \u201cAh ha, here\u2019s what I was looking for!\u00a0 Horse Riding Lessons available at \u2018Fedamore Stables.\u2019\u00a0 They don\u2019t come cheap young lady, and you could fall off a horse and break your neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, mum? You really mean it? I can go horse riding sometime?\u201d I promise I will stop asking you for a horse.\u00a0 I know that a horse needs lots of space.\u00a0 The city is no place for a horse, you are so right mum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell young lady, you are finally growing up,\u201d her mother said smiling.\u00a0 \u201cNow would you kindly go into the bathroom and brush your hair?\u00a0 It looks an absolute mess this morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mum.\u201d Rosie replied.</p><p>Later on that evening Rosie got ready very early for bed.\u00a0 She went into the kitchen and found a nice crunchy carrot and stuck it up her sleeve just in case she happened to go on another adventure.\u00a0 She found her parents in the sitting room enjoying a cup of tea so she kissed them both good night and told them she was off to bed for she couldn\u2019t wait to find out what happened at the end of her book she was reading.</p><p>Rosie looked out her window to see what kind of night it was like.\u00a0 She was delighted to find it was another clear moonlit night.\u00a0 Then into bed she went and just laid there trying to read the same page over and over.\u00a0 It was useless.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t read her book. \u201cLast night was a magical night I wonder if it will ever happen to me again,\u201d she thought.\u00a0 Rosie tossed and turned for what seemed like hours.</p><p>Suddenly she got an idea so she hunted around her room for some notepaper and a pen.\u00a0 She said down at her dressing table and began to write:</p><p>Rosie put the letter in an envelope and licked it closed.\u00a0 Then she shoved it deep into the pocket of her pajamas.\u00a0 She went back to bed and just laid there waiting\u2026.and waiting\u2026..</p><p>Then suddenly, just like before, she felt a weightless feeling wash over her and she knew it was time to rise up out of bed.\u00a0 The magic was happening again.\u00a0 Out through the window she flew.\u00a0 Rosie didn\u2019t waste any time.\u00a0 She knew exactly where she was heading.\u00a0 Soon the lights of the city were behind her and before she knew it she found the field where the sycamore tree stood in the center of the field.\u00a0 Beauty was waiting for her just like the night before.\u00a0 She spied a hay stack and landed on it, then slid down to the ground.\u00a0 Rosie walked over to Beauty and pulled out the carrot from up her sleeve.\u00a0 While he munched on it Rosie whispered something in his ear.\u00a0 Then she gingerly crept on tip toe to the front door of the farmer\u2019s house and quickly slid something into their letter box.\u00a0 Then off again home she flew.</p><p>She was very tired the next morning from being out late two nights in a row.\u00a0 Sitting there eating her breakfast the phone began to ring and her mother answered it. Rosie couldn\u2019t help but overhear.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Mrs. O\u2019Sullivan.\u201d\u00a0 Then came a long moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, yes, my daughter is interested in taking horse riding lessons.\u00a0 Thanks for calling me back.\u00a0 Her name is Rosie. Fedamore Stables, Co Limerick.\u00a0 That\u2019s next Saturday at two o\u2019clock.\u00a0 The first lesson is free you say?\u00a0 That\u2019s great!\u00a0 Your number is 42409.\u00a0 Yes, I will let you know if she can\u2019t come.\u00a0 Thank you so very much.\u00a0 Goodbye!\u201d</p><p>Rosie all this time was sitting on her hands trying to act calm and collected.\u00a0 When her mother finally got off the phone she sat down next to Rosie and told her that her first horse riding lesson would be next Saturday morning.</p><p>\u201cOne free lesson is a pretty good deal, I\u2019d say!\u201d</p><p>Rosie jumped up and hugged her mother real tight for the longest time.</p><p>Saturday couldn\u2019t come quick enough for Rosie.\u00a0 She kept trying on outfits that she thought would best suit for horse riding.\u00a0 She ended up wearing her favourite brown polo neck jumper with the diamond design across the top and her chocolate corduroy pants.\u00a0 She went to her big sisters room and asked to borrow her cowboy boots.\u00a0 She had to promise to do the dishes that night in payment!\u00a0 They were a little big for Rose but she didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 She brushed her hair back into a pony-tail to make sure her hair wouldn\u2019t blow onto her face.\u00a0 She was all set.</p><p>The drive out was painfully slow.\u00a0 The traffic was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\u00a0 It seemed like forever before they came to the place.\u00a0 A black wrought iron sign hung out from the stone wall that said, Fedamore Stables. Up the drive they went.\u00a0 They passed flocks of sheep and a few cows grazed lazily about.\u00a0 Her mother parked the car and as they got out, a lady came up to greet them.</p><p>\u201cOh you must be the O\u2019Sullivans,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m Mary O\u2019Connor and I\u2019ll be giving Rosie her lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you Mrs. O\u2019Connor,\u201d Rosie\u2019s mother replied as she reached out to shake hands.</p><p>\u201cMrs. O\u2019Sullivan you can come back in an hour.\u00a0 We have a lot of work to do, don\u2019t we Rosie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks very much Mrs. O\u2019Connor.\u00a0 Rosie, make sure you do what you are told!\u201d Rosie\u2019s mother said. Then she turned and walked back to her car and drove away.</p><p>They walked towards the stables and Mrs. O\u2019Connor stopped just before they went in and said, \u201cRosie, after I spoke with your mother on the phone the other day I reread a very interesting note that had been slipped into my letterbox.\u00a0 Then I put two and two together.\u00a0 Now I\u2019d like to introduce to you to Chieftain.\u201d</p><p>Then she opened the stable door and there, to Rosie\u2019s amazement, stood \u2018Beauty!\u2019</p>"}
