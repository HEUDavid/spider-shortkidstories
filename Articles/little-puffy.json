he asked \u201call the animals in the forest below need their help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry but my family has gone to the North Pole to cover it with snow.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d asked Little Puffy.</p><p>\u201cLook over there in the middle of the forest, do you see that small wisp of black smoke?\u201d asked the little grey bird, \u201cIt is a campfire that was left by a human family, that is slowly starting to build up, and if someone doesn\u2019t put it out, it will destroy a large part of the forest harming many of the animals.\u201d</p><p>Little Puffy slowly turned to where the little grey bird had pointed, and was able to see the black smoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we are going to do\u201d said the little grey bird, \u201cyour family was our last hope because they would have easily put out the fire with a little of their rain.\u201d</p><p>Just then a thought came to Little Puffy, why couldn\u2019t he help them; he was just as much a cloud as anyone in his family.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry little bird, I will help you!\u201d said Little Puffy.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d asked the little grey bird, \u201cYou are just a little pink cloud, and none of the animals have ever seen you drop any rain or snow on the forest.\u201d</p><p>Little Puffy sucked in as much air as he could, trying to grow as large as he could, but try as he might, he remained a pretty little pink cloud.</p><p>But Little Puffy did not let this stand in his way, \u201cCome on little bird, we have to go put out the fire.\u201d</p><p>And away flew the bird, but Little Puffy could not move, and then he remembered, clouds cannot move without the help of the wind.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I do, there is no wind today, and if wait until one comes up, it may be too late to save the forest.\u201d</p><p>Just then the little grey bird flew back to him, \u201cCome on little cloud, the fire is growing larger, and we don\u2019t have very much time left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just remembered, clouds cannot move without the help of the wind,\u201d said Little Puffy, \u201cand there is no wind blowing at this time to help move me over the fire.\u201d</p><p>Just then, like lightning hitting him, Little Puffy got an idea.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLittle grey bird, do you think that you can ask all the birds of the forest to fly up here to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that if all the birds flap their wings behind me at the same time that they will create sufficient wind to move me over the fire.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of minutes, the little grey bird returned with hundreds of birds, and with their help they created enough wind to move Little Puffy over the fire.</p><p>As Little Puffy looked down, he saw that the fire was now more then just a little wisp of black smoke.\u00a0\u00a0 He could see smoldering ambers glowing a dangerous red color and he knew that flames could sprout at any moment.</p><p>Little Puffy started to strain and squeeze as much as he could, but all that he could generate were a couple of drops of rain which he knew would not be enough to put out the fire.</p><p>Knowing that he was not going to be able to help the forest creatures, Little Puffy\u00a0 became very sad.\u00a0\u00a0 As he continued to think of all the animals that lived in the forest that would be without their homes if the fire were to start, suddenly he started getting darker and darker.</p><p>Then without knowing what was happening, Little Puffy started to cry, and his tears became a torrent of water which fell upon the fire, putting it out.</p><p>Up from the forest arose hundred of voices of little animals \u201cThank you little cloud, for saving our homes.\u201d And Little Puffy felt very happy that he had been able to help them.</p><p>When his family returned from the north pole, his mother Olyntus asked \u201cWell Little Puffy, what did you do while we were gone?\u201d \u201cNothing exciting\u201d replied Little Puffy, but from that day on, Little Puffy did not feel any less a cumulus cloud then the rest of his family, knowing that in times of need, he would also be able to contribute to the needs of the world.</p>"}
