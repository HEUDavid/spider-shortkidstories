Light Above.</p><p>Girl Bulb : I think it\u2019s finally warming up above. Almost time to push out.</p><p>Boy Bulb : What\u2019s the rush? I like it here. It\u2019s warm enough. There\u2019s still plenty to eat.</p><p>Girl: You really have no choice.</p><p>Boy: Why? Is this my fate?</p><p>Girl: It is\u2013 for both of us. And you\u2019re an early bloomer.</p><p>Boy: I want more from life than living a short dull life, then shriveling up and die. I want to soar on winds or be king of the jungle, conquering all before me.</p><p>Girl : You\u2019re a TULIP!</p><p>Boy: A daffodil actually, narcissus type. I don\u2019t know how I got tossed in with this group.</p><p>Girl : You still bring beauty to others.</p><p>Boy: I don\u2019t see the beauty in standing around all day in one place, swaying in the wind with bees poking at you.</p><p>Girl : Basking in the sun, looking at the trees and all the other flowers. That\u2019s heavenly. Didn\u2019t your mother teach you this?</p><p>Boy: I\u2019ve heard stories of Uncle Ralph getting trampled by children and Grandma Lorraine eaten by a deer. Ghastly! It\u2019s not safe out there. It\u2019s safe here in our beds.</p><p>Girl : There\u2019s nothing more sad than having an animal or human dig you out of the ground before you\u2019ve had a chance to bloom.</p><p>Boy: This is what I was made to do, is what you\u2019re saying.</p><p>Girl : That\u2019s right. Push on.</p><p>Boy: You\u2019ll miss me.</p><p>Girl : Some of us will be right behind you. I\u2019m a late bloomer. I\u2019ll see you in late Spring.</p><p>Boy: When I\u2019m shriveled and old, ready to fade to nothing.</p><p>Girl : You can be re-planted and grow again next year. And if you\u2019ve been a good flower, eventually you go to heaven. Or perhaps you prefer your karma? You be a good tulip and in a few generations or so, you can maybe become an oak tree or even a frog.</p><p>Boy: Sounds exhausting! Can I stay in bed just a couple more days?</p><p>Girl : It\u2019s your time. Go!</p><p>Boy: Well, maybe I\u2019ll see other daffodils out in the sunlight.</p><p>Girl : That\u2019s the spirit!</p><p>Boy: Adios, my friends. May your short Spring be sweet.</p><p>Girl : You leave here a bulb. Soon you become a flower!</p><p>(short silence)</p><p>Boy: Stay back!
