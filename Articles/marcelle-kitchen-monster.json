I was there and this is the story.</p><p>I noticed that Marcelle wasn\u2019t sleeping yet.</p><p>\u201cHaving sleep problems Little Marcelle?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry, I don\u2019t want to sleep yet and I\u2019m bored!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s go get something to eat,\u201d I said, like if it was a simple matter and before her answer I noticed a couple of tiny little tears on her tiny little cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d She said, \u201cMommy is out somewhere, the Nanny is already snoring on the couch and that monster\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say monster Marcelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! A tall, cold, black giant monster that lives in the kitchen and makes the most horrible noises ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She continued, \u201cThe monster only listens to Mommy because only she knows how to take food from him. Why does he have to keep our food? That\u2019s unfair! I\u2019m going to starve here!\u201d She started crying.</p><p>I went to Marcelle\u2019s toy box, made an improvised armor for myself and grabbed a lighting-magic-stick for her. \u201cWe are going to get some food miss,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut if Nanny sees us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be careful,\u201d I said as I opened the door.</p><p>\u201cBut the monster always make those noises when I\u2019m around, it\u2019s like as if he were about to eat me\u2026\u201d</p><p>I had to interrupt her. \u201cMarcelle, we are not just going for food, we are going to face your fear. After tonight, you won\u2019t be afraid anymore because you will know how to tame the monster in order to get food. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>So we left Marcelle\u2019s room, the pink walls, the pink carpet, the pink curtains and the white bed. We left everything behind and there we were at the edge of the stairs, ready for our adventure.</p><p>We had to be very careful going down the stair because they were old and loud. However, the real danger was waiting for us downstairs.</p><p>In order to get to the kitchen we had to cross the living room. We saw the Nanny\u2019s leg hanging from one side of the couch, is sleeping I thought, so we decided to sneak behind the couch when suddenly\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou know what girl? I can\u2019t even\u2026\u201d She wasn\u2019t sleeping, she was talking on her cellphone, and now we were stuck behind the couch.</p><p>\u201cWe are lost\u2026,\u201d I said but Marcelle interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Without hesitating she took off her right shoe and threw it to the stairs.</p><p>The Nanny put the cellphone down, stood up, stared at the stairs for a moment and then she got back to the couch and grabbed the cellphone again, \u201cSo, where were we? Oh yeah! Romantic Vampires!\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t enough, we needed a louder sound, so Marcelle took off her left shoe, and threw it farther. This time the shoe hit the door. The Nanny dropped the cellphone and went to the door. \u201cHello?\u201d she said. She was scared.</p><p>This was our opportunity. We ran as fast as we could to the kitchen, and we made it.</p><p>From the kitchen\u2019s entrance we could see his enormous figure standing there in silence. The monster seemed to be sleeping, so we decided to approach him, walking carefully, trying not to wake him.</p><p>When we got near him we stood in silence for a while, we were amazed by our achievement.</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d I said, \u201cand now what?\u201d</p><p>Marcelle was walking around, studying the monster, \u201cMommy always gets the food from inside of him, so I say we should open him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s do it together,\u201d I said, \u201cwe made it so far so this will be easy.\u201d</p><p>We put our hands on the edge of what it seemed to be a door on the front of the strange creature. \u201cAt the count of three we pull together, ready?\u201d The monster\u2019s skin was very cold. We said together, \u201cone, two\u2026\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, our count was interrupted by the most horrifying sound that I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. It was like the sound of one hundred buses starting up at the same time, like one thousand trucks honking together, it was a big and loud, \u201cROAR.\u201d</p><p>Marcelle and I took cover behind a chair, the sound was getting louder and there was nowhere to go.</p><p>\u201cLittle Marcelle,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll will distract him, please leave, save yourself.\u201d I took Marcelle\u2019s lighting-magic-stick and went to face the monster. I was hitting him with all my strength trying to distract him, but Marcelle wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cGo away Marcelle! Run!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>After a while, my arms were getting tired and Marcelle wasn\u2019t moving yet, she was just staring at me fighting the monster. She was crying.</p><p>Suddenly I heard her yelling, \u201cis not fair! I am hungry!\u201d She didn\u2019t mind the roar, she ran directly to the monster\u2019s door and started pulling. I dropped the stick and helped her with door.</p><p>The door opened and the monster threw a sort of orange fluid on us. I pushed Marcelle away and then everything turned orange for me. I just remember Marcelle crying over me, and then I heard Mommy\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cMarcelle sweetheart, what are you doing? Are you all right? All the grandma\u2019s carrot soup is on the floor, what happened?\u201d</p><p>Marcelle was sobbing, \u201cI was hungry and you weren\u2019t here, and I didn\u2019t want to sleep, and now Mr. Bunny is all covered in soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marcelle,\u201d said Mommy grabbing her and closing the monster\u2019s door, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, let\u2019s get something to eat, then we are going to wash Mr. Bunny and he will be all right.\u201d</p><p>The next day I was in the laundry room, happy because I wasn\u2019t orange anymore, and happy because I knew that Marcelle wasn\u2019t afraid of the refrigerator anymore. It doesn\u2019t matter how small we are, we are always capable of conquer our fears. I was clean and ready for another adventure.</p>"}
