Silver-grey cobwebs hung from the ceiling, cascading down the walls and windows, creating a curtain of animated gossamer.\u00a0 An array of dead flies and weevils lay rotting on the filthy windowsills.\u00a0 Large drops of rain bounced off the grimy glass, a timpani of ominous throbs.</p><p>A shimmer of movement shattered the blackness.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u00a0 Joe turned swiftly.</p><p>A large, black rat scurried out from his hidey-hole stopping in the centre of the long lost lounge.\u00a0 He sniffed the air, his nose and whiskers twitching, his yellow, beady eyes surveying the room.</p><p>Joe bolted back into the hallway, his momentum ploughing him through the door of the room opposite.\u00a0 Rats!\u00a0 He hated rats!</p><p>Was being alone in this abandoned house with a nest of rats preferable to being out in a storm?</p><p>His heart beating fast, a sudden clatter of metal on ceramic tile caused Joe to stop in his tracks.\u00a0 He stood stock-still.\u00a0 He barely breathed.\u00a0 His mouth was dry.\u00a0 His whole body trembled.\u00a0 His senses strained to hear and see into the blackness of the second room.</p><p>A cloying odour invaded his nostrils.\u00a0 A strong pungent smell.\u00a0 Yuk!\u00a0 His nose wrinkled and he involuntarily put his hand to his mouth.\u00a0 A chill breeze blew across his fingers.\u00a0 Another clatter of metal on tile screeched through the darkness.\u00a0 Joe screamed and fell to the floor.</p><p>He didn\u2019t land on the cold broken floor.\u00a0 To his surprise he fell onto a soft, damp cushion.</p><p>What on earth?</p><p>His hands involuntarily grasped the wadded, musty material.\u00a0 It was dark in colour and the shape was indiscernible. The smell was disgusting.\u00a0 Joe gagged and hurriedly clambered to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta get out of here.\u201d</p><p>His fall had disorientated him.\u00a0 In the blackness of the room he\u2019d no idea where the door was located.\u00a0 He opened his eyes wider again in the hope he could discern some shapes, some recognisable forms.</p><p>A sudden flash of lightning lit up his environment. But instead of finding himself alone in a room, a mirror image of the rat infested lounge, the unexpected light revealed a monstrous, shadowy shape of a man bearing down on him.\u00a0 Joe shrieked in terror.\u00a0 He spun away from the immanent threat and, panic-stricken, ran in the opposite direction.</p><p>Terrified beyond senseless, a boom of thunder coincided with his collision into a wall.\u00a0 He crumpled to the floor. \u00a0Heavy sobs built up in his throat.\u00a0 He had entered a nightmare.\u00a0 Stumbling and scratching at the walls, Joe struggled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself badly, if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d a reassuring voice whispered in his ear.</p><p>Torchlight suddenly shone in Joe\u2019s face.\u00a0 He squinted and the circle of light dropped slightly illuminating his immediate surroundings.</p><p>Paddy Kelly, Joe\u2019s older cousin and partner in crime stood before him.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me quite a scare,\u201d chuckled Paddy, a lad of seventeen going on seventy.\u00a0 \u201cI thought you were the cops!\u201d\u00a0 He shone the torch on the far wall revealing a web of cracked and falling plaster surrounding a large marble fireplace.\u00a0 Joe quickly surmised Paddy, masked in an old dark green anorak and tattered khakis, had been removing the ornamental, stone mantelpiece.\u00a0 The clatter of metal on tiles had been Paddy\u2019s hammer and chisel, the tools of his criminal trade, when they had fallen to the floor.</p><p>Paddy grinned, revealing unsightly, yellow teeth.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll get a good price for it.\u00a0 These old houses are filled with treasures.\u201d\u00a0 He bent down and placed the torch on the floor so it strategically shone on his handiwork.\u00a0 He then picked up tools and began to chip away at the undamaged plaster.\u00a0 With each crunch of the hammer, the fireplace loosened.</p><p>Joe smiled and in a tone of bravado, he far from felt, said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch.\u201d\u00a0 He did not want to admit he had been as frightened as Paddy \u2013 if not more so.</p><p>\u201cFair play, my lad.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be a few euro in it for you, as usual,\u201d Paddy muttered, hitting the chisel with a firm thump of his hammer.</p><p>Now fully cognisant of the room, which had once been a second lounge, Joe turned towards the door only to see a dirty, old duvet on the floor.\u00a0 He realised this was the cause of the offensive smell and deduced Paddy would later use it to wrap up his ill-gotten gains.\u00a0 He wiped his hands on his trousers and re-entered the hallway.\u00a0 Slowly he pulled open the large, wooden door, aided by the pressure of the wind and rain.</p><p>A dark, upright figure stood silently before him.\u00a0 Joe\u2019s mouth dropped open and a scream struggled in his throat.\u00a0 His body shook and terror engulfed him once again as the tall figure on the porch towered over him.</p><p>\u201cSpotted the bike outside. Very similar to one just reported stolen.\u201d\u00a0 Sergeant Murphy\u2019s baritone revealed the true horror of Joe\u2019s situation.\u00a0 The burly policeman peered into the darkness over Joe\u2019s trembling shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cBut what are you up to in here?\u201d</p>"}
