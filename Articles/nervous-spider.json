He always hated this moment, when an insect trapped itself in his web.</p><p>He knew he was expected to rush over and finish them off. A quick bite to paralyse them and then wrap them in silk. It\u2019s what he was brought up to do. And of course he was hungry.</p><p>Adrian sat in the centre of his web and hesitated. What if it\u2019s frightened, or angry? He didn\u2019t want to have to deal with that. Meanwhile, the web shook more and more violently. He started to worry. He began to worry that if he didn\u2019t do something, it might bring the whole web down.</p><p>\u201cGo on you wimp, get in there for kill, scaredy pants!\u201d heard Adrian from behind. He looked back and across to his neighbour, Biffer, the nasty spider that lived next to him in his web on a nearby branch. He was about three times the size of Adrian. He was always teasing him and calling him names. Biffer had a mean smile on his face as he raced closer to the edge of his web, only inches from Adrian\u2019s. It was as if he was delighted that Adrian was uncomfortable. He stopped, puffed up his chest and looked around to make sure the other spiders all around were listening.</p><p>\u201cOr are you too chicken?\u201d mocked Biffer. \u201cBock bock, bock bock BAWCK!\u201d Adrian heard the laughter of all the spiders in the webs close by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hop over and finish him off for you if you\u2019re too scared!\u201d continued Biffer, to more laughs all round. That was of course the last thing Adrian wanted.</p><p>\u201cNo need, Biffer, I\u2019ve got the situation under control,\u201d replied Adrian, more firmly than he felt. He decided to go over and just do what nature intended. It\u2019s what he always did. To get it over with. The sooner he did it, the sooner he could get some peace again. From the insect and from Biffer. But he didn\u2019t like it. He dashed off, his legs expertly dancing over the non-sticky parts of the web towards his prey. He heard Biffer shout something else he couldn\u2019t quite make out, causing another peal of laughter from the others.</p><p>When he arrived at the far side of the web, he found there was a large fly thrashing around, trying to escape. It was only getting itself more stuck in the silk of the web. Adrian couldn\u2019t help noticing its huge head, much larger than usual. When it saw Adrian, its huge eyes bulged in panic.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d it cried. \u201cDon\u2019t bite me, please!\u201d</p><p>Adrian stopped short. He was quite shocked, as none of his victims had ever spoken to him before. He thought he might be hearing things.</p><p>\u201cEh, excuse me?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you actually say something there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied the fly. \u201cI said, please, please don\u2019t bite me. Please!\u201d It immediately started thrashing again, trying to free itself.</p><p>\u201cStop bouncing around, you\u2019re shaking my web, you might break it,\u201d replied Adrian.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about your horrible web,\u201d it responded. \u201cYou are so nasty, trapping people like this. You should be ashamed. You deserve to be\u2026\u201d</p><p>The fly stopped itself and thought again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean to take it out on you,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cI know this is just what you do. But when you\u2019re the one that\u2019s caught, well it\u2019s not very pleasant, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d replied Adrian. \u201cI have never heard a fly speak before. You do have a funny accent, but perfectly understandable.\u201d</p><p>The fly had stopped thrashing around at this stage, but it was still gulping air. It stared its big eyes at Adrian, awaiting his next move. Adrian stared back at the fly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been lovely chatting, but I suppose I better get on with the bite now,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cI\u2019ll try to do it quickly so it won\u2019t hurt too much, I promise.\u201d</p><p>The fly started to weep floods of tears.</p><p>\u201cAh now, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, this sort of thing happens all the time in nature. It will be over very quickly, I promise. I\u2019ll be eating you in no time.\u201d Adrian tried a bit of a smile to show the fly his softer side and that he wasn\u2019t all bad.</p><p>\u201cActually technically, it\u2019s drinking, not eating,\u201d replied the fly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Drinking? How do you mean?\u201d asked Adrian.</p><p>\u201cWell, after you bite me, your poison, it\u2019s called venom, it turns my insides into mush. Then you suck it all out, like drinking from a straw. Drinking, not eating. Surely you know that? I mean, you must do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought of it like that before,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cI do believe you are right. OK then, I\u2019ll be drinking you in no time!\u201d</p><p>The fly\u2019s face fell. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel better that you realise that now,\u201d it replied and immediately started to cry again.</p><p>\u201cAh no, don\u2019t start with the water-works,\u201d replied Adrian. \u201cI hate it when you guys start blubbering, I really do. This sort of thing happens all the time, it\u2019s nothing to be upset about.\u201d</p><p>The fly looked up at Adrian. \u201cYou guys? That\u2019s not very nice you know, to speak to me like that. You guys, you say, as if we\u2019re all the same, not individuals with hopes and dreams of our own for the future. You are not being very sensitive.\u201d</p><p>Adrian felt a bit guilty as the fly continued on speaking, almost as if to himself.</p><p>\u201cI never got to say goodbye to Margie and Damian. They\u2019ll be upset and they\u2019ll wonder what happened to me and be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are Margie and Damian?\u201d Adrian found himself asking.</p><p>The fly smiled a dreamy smile through the tears. \u201cMargie is the love of my life,\u201d it said. \u201cWe met some time ago at the edge of a jam sandwich. She got trapped by the stickiness and I managed to get her out. We fell in love. We\u2019ve been so happy together. Then we had Damian, he\u2019s my little boy. He is such fun. When tries to fly he keeps bumping off the ground before he takes off. He makes us so proud.\u201d</p><p>At this stage Adrian felt something. He didn\u2019t know what it was, but he felt something inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping you?\u201d heard Adrian from a distance. It was Biffer. He was still watching from the edge of his web. \u201cNo need for a heart-to-heart, wimp, just go in and bite!\u201d continued Biffer. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to listen to his life-story!\u201d Again, Adrian heard more laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Adrian, softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d replied the fly. \u201cWhy do you need a name on your meal? Doesn\u2019t that make it harder, to eat something with a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d insisted Adrian. \u201cTell me or I\u2019ll finish you off right now.\u201d</p><p>The fly looked back at Adrian. \u201cIt\u2019s Brainfly,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy parents always said I was really smart, so they called me Brainfly. Maybe it\u2019s my big head. Silly name I know.\u201d</p><p>Adrian looked at Brainfly and looked away. Then he looked back again.</p><p>\u201cHow come you can speak?\u201d asked Adrian. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened. I can honest say I have never, ever held a conversation with my lunch before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up on a tree not far from here,\u201d replied the Brainfly. \u201cThere were spiders all around and I used to listen to them at night talking. After a while I started to understand what they were saying to one another. I used to keep well away, but one night I started to try to speak to them. They were laughing at me and kept inviting me over to their webs so that I could speak some more to them, but of course I never did. I didn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Adrian.</p><p>\u201cWell, I could understand what they were saying,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cThey were always talking about food and what a great lunch they had on this insect or that. I knew that if I went over I\u2019d never get away. But I kept listening and speaking from a distance.\u201d</p><p>Adrian was getting tired from all the chatting. \u201cListen, Brainfly. I like you, you are nice. You have a wife, a little kid. I feel guilty eating you. No, sorry, drinking you. But on the other hand, I am a spider. Spiders have to eat. I get hungry and in spite of how I like you personally, you look delicious. Use that big brain of yours. What should I do? What would you do in my situation?\u201d</p><p>Brainfly thought a moment.</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>Thinking, thinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breaking the rules if I tell you,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to tell anyone about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot supposed to tell anyone about what?\u201d asked Adrian.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you about what, then I will have told you what I\u2019m not supposed to tell you, stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be mush in minutes,\u201d replied Adrian, not happy at being called stupid, especially by a fly.</p><p>Brainfly looked away, torn. He looked back at Adrian. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t tell a soul?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly in a strong position to ask for anything.\u201d</p><p>Brainfly looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear.</p><p>\u201cOK then. I\u2019ll trust you. Become a vegetarian,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMove to Splyderville and become a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa there!\u201d laughed Adrian. \u201cWhat\u2019s a vegetarian? And what and where is this Splyderville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vegetarian is someone who only eats plants,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cYou could just eat plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like the idea of that,\u201d replied Adrian. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound very tasty, or nutritious. That\u2019s not natural for a spider, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cI studied this at Splyderville University. Not all spiders in the world eat flies or insects, in fact. I learned that there are forty thousand species of spider and there is one called Bagheera kiplingi\u00a0that eats plant buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlies go to university?\u201d asked Adrian. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of people outside of Splyderville know about the university,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cIt\u2019s only for the gifted flies that are discovered early. The clever young spiders of Splyderville also go. We go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on just a minute,\u201d demanded Adrian. \u201cYou really expect me to believe there\u2019s a place called Splyderville where spiders and flies go to university together? You really think I must be an idiot if you think I\u2019m going to swallow that one. I know I\u2019m the spider, but you\u2019re the one spinning a web of lies to save your skin! That\u2019s it, I\u2019ve had enough of this. I\u2019m going to finish you off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Brainfly. \u201cIt\u2019s really true! It\u2019s a wonderful place. I think you\u2019d love it there. You wouldn\u2019t have to kill insects any more. Instead you would be eating the most delicious plant-buds all day long as you live in harmony and fun with us flies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did this so-called Splyderville get set up in the first place?\u201d asked Adrian. \u201cHow come the spiders don\u2019t just take over and eat all the flies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur founding father, he\u2019s called Papa Juan Carlos, he set it up,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cHe\u2019s a Baheera kiplingi himself. After leaving his home in Mexico, he travelled the world as a performing acrobat in a circus, met Lucy, his wife, had forty seven children and ended up staying here. When the other spiders around noticed that none of his family ever ate flies or insects, they were curious. He taught them how to survive without needing to trap and eat insects. The flies moved in a short time later, as they felt so safe there. Before long a whole community was established. I only moved in with Margie and Damian last month when I heard about it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to meet you if you decide to abdicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbdicate? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked Adrian.</p><p>\u201cAbdicate is the name we use for what a spider does who decides to give up normal spiderhood move across from their normal insect-eating world into Splyderville. There\u2019s even an abdication team to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just too far-fetched,\u201d replied Adrian, shaking his head. \u201cYou really expect me to believe all that? It\u2019s just a cock-and-bull story you have made up to trick me into releasing you.\u201d Then Adrian hesitated. \u201cHow do I know if these plant buds taste OK?\u201d he continued. \u201cThey sound disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get some for you,\u201d replied Brainfly quickly. \u201cIf you release me, I\u2019ll bring it back for you straight away. You can try it before you abdicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, Brainfly. Once I release you, I\u2019ll never see you again, that\u2019s for sure. And I never said I would do this so-called abdicate thingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I swear, eh, your name, what\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Brainfly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking all this time and I don\u2019t even know your name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear Adrian, on my fly-honour, I will return with the most delicious plant buds you have ever tasted. All the spiders are allowed try out the food before they move in. To find out if they will like it or not in advance. I can go there and bring back some food for you. I can even call out the abdication team and we can take you out of here forever. Please, you\u2019ll love it in Splyderville Adrian. Mate. Buddy. My friend?\u201d Brainfly finished this with a brave smile.</p><p>Adrian sat and thought to himself. Splyderville? Abdication team? Plant buds? This was getting more ridiculous by the minute. A place where spiders and flies live in harmony together? It really must be a made-up place just so this devious fly can escape his web. Here was a brainy fly, the brainiest he had ever met, that was for sure. He could talk, he was friendly. He had a wife. A little kid. He was claiming that there existed a place where spiders and flies could live together? Without the spiders eating them? Crazy!</p><p>Adrian was torn. But what if such a place really did exist? A tiny spark of hope lit up inside him. He realised he wanted to believe it could be true. What to do? He could eat (or drink) Brainfly for a quick snack and that would be that. Or, he could give him a chance. If he came back, then it might be a solution to his problem. If not, then what had he lost? There\u2019ll be more insects along in time and at least he could say he tried to find a different way.</p><p>Finally Adrian turned back to Brainfly, who was waiting with a strained look of patience on his face. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll let you go,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cBut you have to promise to come back with the plant buds. No trickery. Cross your wings and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank you, thank you,\u201d replied Brainfly. \u201cI cross my wings and hope to die.\u201d He beamed a huge smile back at Adrian, who couldn\u2019t help himself smiling back.</p><p>Adrian got busy untangling Brainfly from the silk. It was hard work, as he was more used to wrapping up his victims in silk rather than releasing them. It was all he could do to stop himself biting his venom into the now calm insect in his web.</p><p>\u201cPlease release me, let me go,\u201d sang Brainfly cheerily, laughing as did so.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201d called Biffer from the far side. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are releasing him? That\u2019s breaking spider laws! Insects may NEVER be released from a web once they are trapped, you traitor! We have our reputation to think of. The punishment is very hard!\u201d</p><p>Adrian ignored him and after much work, Brainfly was free. He buzzed his wings and hovered in the air above Adrian.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Brainfly and he was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this!\u201d shouted Biffer from his web. \u201cI\u2019ve reported you to the Spolice. They\u2019re going to wrap you up and throw away the key.\u201d</p><p>Adrian groaned inwardly. The Spolice were the dreaded police force of the spider community. They were known for how cruelly they like to treat their prisoners. Wrapping them up tightly so they couldn\u2019t even move. Giving them hardly any food. Teasing them, making fun of them, poking them. Making their lives miserable. He had forgotten that releasing a fly was breaking the law in the world of spiders. He gulped and started to feel sick.</p><p>Adrian returned to the centre of his web. One hour passed. No Brainfly. Two hours. Three hours. Still no Brainfly. No plant buds. No nothing. Just the angry words of Biffer as he continuously filled him in on how soon the Spolice would be arriving.</p><p>What a fool I have been, thought Adrian. I should never have listened to that crafty little fly. Vegetarian spider my foot. \u00a0Splyderville, living in harmony with flies. Bah! What a joke. I\u2019ll be the laughing stock of the spider community as I\u2019m hauled off by the Spolice. He felt his tummy rumble. He drifted off to fitful, restless sleep, dreaming of being wrapped up like a trussed-up turkey at the centre of the Spolice prison web, unable to move.</p><p>Some time later, Adrian awoke to the feel of his web shaking violently. He looked across to see Biffer moving towards him, surrounded by three Spolice officers looking very serious and angry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him, arrest him!\u201d called Biffer. \u201cHe released a perfectly good and juicy fly earlier. I heard them talking and then he let him go. He didn\u2019t perform his spiderly duties!\u201d</p><p>Adrian raced away to the far end of his web. I\u2019m done for now, he thought. He closed his eyes and waited for what would happen. I hope they won\u2019t hurt me too much, he prayed.</p><p>Then, as Biffer and the Spolice moved ever closer towards him, he heard the sound of buzzing above his head. He opened the pair of eyes on the roof of his head and looked up. There were three flies hovering above. The smallest one seemed a bit unstable, it kept bashing off the other two uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d cried Brainfly. \u201cSay hello to Margie and Damian. They wanted to come to say thanks!\u201d</p><p>Adrian knew it was too late, but he was happy to see them anyway. \u201c\u2019Hi Margie, Hi Damian. Brainfly, I\u2019m in trouble,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cThe Spolice are going to take me away. I broke the spider laws by releasing you. I thought you weren\u2019t coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you had tricked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d said Brainfly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that. You are my friend now, unlikely as that is outside Splyderville! We brought you some tasty buds to eat.\u201d</p><p>With that, the flies dropped a few pieces of food down onto the web beside Adrian. This just infuriated Biffer and the Spolice even more and they started charging towards him, shouting and screaming as they did.</p><p>\u201cI might as well try it now,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be my last supper.\u201d</p><p>Adrian took a nibble of the food. And another. And another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d he called up to Brainfly, \u201creally delicious. He looked up and met Brainfly\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I let you go. Splyderville sounds nice. I think I would have liked it there. It\u2019s a pity I\u2019ll never get to see it now.\u201d</p><p>Biffer and the Spolice agents were now only inches away from Adrian. He could see the whites of their eyes, their faces etched with a snarling anger. The Spolice had eight silk-cuffs ready to tie up each of Adrian\u2019s legs in a moment. Their mouths were frozen into a cruel, hateful sneer.</p><p>Again, Adrian closed his eyes and waited for the worst to happen. It\u2019s all over, he thought. Goodbye freedom.</p><p>But then, Adrian heard another loud noise above. He looked up, confused. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the abdication team, Adrian. Quick, Papa Juan Carlos will help you!\u201d</p><p>Adrian took in the scene above his head. It must have been several hundred flies that had arrived in formation. There seemed to be a giant floating web weaved between all of their legs. And hanging down on a single swinging thread, from the centre of that web, was a colourful, jolly looking spider with a big grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cJump on my friend,\u201d he called. \u201cMy name ees Juan Carlos. I teenk we are just een time to leeft you out of dees place.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Adrian noticed he was spinning and lowering another thread of silk down towards him.</p><p>At this stage he could feel Biffer\u2019s breath upon him. The Spolice were at his legs about to lock him in the silk cuffs. There was no time for thinking. He grabbed onto the dangling silk thread and wove a thread of his own around it.</p><p>\u201cLeeft! Leeft,\u201d cried Papa Juan Carlos to the flies above.</p><p>Adrian felt himself rise up. He could feel weights hanging off two of his legs as he gained height. He looked down. Already the ground was far below. He felt dizzy, but then a shock when he saw what was underneath him. Biffer and one of the Spolice officers were still attached to his legs by threads of silk and were climbing up towards him as they all rose higher into the air together, lifted by the fly formation.</p><p>Adrian kicked as hard as he could. This only made the spiders below more angry and climb even faster towards him. Adrian was exhausted, he felt hardly any strength left to fight. With one huge final effort, he gave one leg an almighty kick. The Spolice officer fell away with a cry and Adrian felt the weight off his leg.</p><p>He had not time to celebrate though, as Biffer still remained swaying in the wind below him and was redoubling his efforts to get up. Adrian had no energy left to fight any more. One more time, he closed his eyes as he waited for Biffer\u2019s blows rain upon him.</p><p>By this time, Papa Juan Carlos had connected Adrian directly to the web above being carried by the flies and was now coming down himself. As he passed by, Adrian opened his eyes just in time to see Papa Juan Carlos wink at him, and then continue on down to Biffer.</p><p>Biffer wasn\u2019t used to spiders not being afraid of him. Papa Juan Carlos wasn\u2019t a big spider, but he was very strong and fearless. You could tell he was not to be messed with. Biffer gulped when Juan Carlos calmly climbed down to him and looked him straight in the eye. They eyeballed each other for a minute until Biffer thought better of any fight with him and let go of the thread. Adrian watched as Biffer drifted down, down, down and out of sight.</p><p>It was an amazing flight all the way to Splyderville! Adrian had never been so high before. He could see over the countryside, all the way to the mountains in the east and to the sea in the west. It looked magnificent, unlike anything he had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the sea before,\u201d he yelled out to Papa Juan Carlos, who at this stage had returned to the web above.</p><p>\u201cJust hang on,\u201d laughed Papa Juan Carlos. \u201cWe won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>When they landed in Splyderville, the whole village was out to greet him. Everyone applauded and took him on a tour. It was amazing! Adrian was astounded by everything he saw. The spiders had made non-sticky webs for use as trampolines for the baby-flies. They seemed to really love it and bounced on it all day long. Adrian could see the spiders giving them spider-back rides too. It looked such fun to see dozens of fly-babies giggling and bouncing up and down on the back of a giant spider.</p><p>Later, Adrian was brought to the abdication arrivals centre, which was a unit inside of Splyderville University. It was run by none other than Lucy, Papa Juan Carlos\u2019s beautiful wife who was in charge there. Adrian went a bit red, as he wasn\u2019t used to being in the company of beautiful lady spiders.</p><p>\u201cYou are very welcome to Splyderville,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cWe hope you will love your new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the food?\u201d asked Adrian. \u201cWho collects all the food?\u201d Adrian\u2019s tummy had started to rumble again.</p><p>Lucy laughed. \u201cYou abdicators, all you think about is your stomachs. So sweet. Let me tell you how it works. The flies are really good at collecting the plant buds for the spiders to eat. In fact your friend Brainfly is one of the best, so you are in luck. There are many different varieties of pant-buds, and we try new ones all the time. There\u2019s also a cooking school you can join if you\u2019d like to learn how to make delicious new dishes.\u201d</p><p>Adrian was delighted to hear about all of this and spend a fascinating few hours learning all about the workings of Splyderville.</p><p>That evening, Adrian had been shown to his new home, a small tree with lovely views over countryside. He had spun up a new, non-sticky web in no time. Brainfly popped around for a visit.</p><p>\u201cWell, how to you like your new home?\u201d asked Brainfly.</p><p>Adrian looked out at the sun setting over the beautiful countryside below him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to like it here, Brainfly, I really am. Now, where are those plant-buds you promised me, servant?\u201d</p><p>Brainfly responded by throwing a plant-bud at Adrian\u2019s head. It was late into the night before they stopped playing, eating, chatting and laughing. Finally they said goodnight and Brainfly went home. As Adrian closed his eyes to sleep later, he hoped that he wouldn\u2019t wake up to find it had all been just a dream.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t.</p>"}
