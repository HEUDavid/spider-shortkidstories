Piper was afraid.</p><p>He was the largest dog in the whole bunch! He could have eaten all those dogs for lunch! In his mind that didn\u2019t matter much. Piper was afraid.</p><p>The floor creaked when he left his chair, so all day long he just stayed there. Piper was afraid.</p><p>The other dogs all ran and played, the sun was high and the horses neighed. But all this he missed each day because Piper was afraid.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/PiperWasAfraid-WEB_version-20-opt.jpg'></img><p>One evening there was quite a storm. It was a summer night and the house got warm, and Piper, he was all alone! Piper was afraid!</p><p>His family owned a lovely Inn, and although they had invited him to come that day and meet the guests\u2026 he stayed at home and didn\u2019t join the rest, because Piper was afraid.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/PiperWasAfraid-WEB_version-22-opt.jpg'></img><p>Well now as the thunder grew louder and LOUDER and the big old house had lost its power\u2026 The rain slammed heavily on the roof and Piper was afraid!!</p><p>Terrified, he crept off his chair and wedged himself underneath the stairs. he was SO big that he got stuck there! PIPER WAS AFRAID!!</p><p>When his family came home later that night, they pulled him out and hugged him tight; then all six dogs did reunite! Piper was no longer afraid.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/PiperWasAfraid-WEB_version-28-opt.jpg'></img><p>I\u2019ll never stay home alone again! I\u2019ll join in the fun and be as BRAVE as I can!\u201d whimpered Piper.</p><p>He meant what he said because he was never afraid again!</p>"}
