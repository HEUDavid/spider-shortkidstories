Let\u2019s all go in search of something to eat!\u201d cried all the other dollies.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mistress had me out playing with her this morning,\u201d said Raggedy Ann, \u201cshe carried me by a door near the back of the house and I smelled something which smelled as if it would taste delicious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you lead the way, Raggedy Ann!\u201d cried the French dolly.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be a good plan to elect Raggedy Ann as our leader on this expedition!\u201d said the Indian doll.</p><p>At this all the other dolls clapped their hands together and shouted, \u201cHurrah! Raggedy Ann will be our leader.\u201d</p><p>So Raggedy Ann, very proud indeed to have the confidence and love of all the other dollies, said that she would be very glad to be their leader.</p><p>\u201cFollow me!\u201d she cried as her wobbly legs carried her across the floor at a lively pace.</p><p>The other dollies followed, racing about the house until they came to the pantry door. \u201cThis is the place!\u201d cried Raggedy Ann, and sure enough, all the dollies smelled something which they knew must be very good to eat.</p><p>But none of the dollies was tall enough to open the door and, although they pushed and pulled with all their might, the door remained tightly closed.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1a-tb.jpg'></img><p>The dollies were talking and pulling and pushing and every once in a while one would fall over and the others would step on her in their efforts to open the door. Finally Raggedy Ann drew away from the others and sat down on the floor.</p><p>When the other dollies discovered Raggedy Ann sitting there, running her rag hands through her yarn hair, they knew she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cSh! Sh!\u201d they said to each other and quietly went over near Raggedy Ann and sat down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThere must be a way to get inside,\u201d said Raggedy Ann.</p><p>\u201cRaggedy says there must be a way to get inside!\u201d cried all the dolls.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to think clearly to-day,\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cIt feels as if my head were ripped.\u201d</p><p>At this the French doll ran to Raggedy Ann and took off her bonnet. \u201cYes, there is a rip in your head, Raggedy!\u201d she said and pulled a pin from her skirt and pinned up Raggedy\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very neat job, for I got some puckers in it!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh that is ever so much better!\u201d cried Raggedy Ann. \u201cNow I can think quite clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Raggedy can think quite clearly!\u201d cried all the dolls.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts must have leaked out the rip before!\u201d said Raggedy Ann.</p><p>\u201cThey must have leaked out before, dear Raggedy!\u201d cried all the other dolls.</p><p>\u201cNow that I can think so clearly,\u201d said Raggedy Ann, \u201cI think the door must be locked and to get in we must unlock it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be easy!\u201d said the Dutch doll who says \u201cMamma\u201d when he is tipped backward and forward, \u201cFor we will have the brave tin soldier shoot the key out of the lock!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1b-tb.jpg'></img><p>\u201cI can easily do that!\u201d cried the tin soldier, as he raised his gun.</p><p>\u201cOh, Raggedy Ann!\u201d cried the French dolly. \u201cPlease do not let him shoot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cWe must think of a quieter way!\u201d</p><p>After thinking quite hard for a moment, Raggedy Ann jumped up and said: \u201cI have it!\u201d And she caught up the Jumping Jack and held him up to the door; then Jack slid up his stick and unlocked the door.</p><p>Then the dollies all pushed and the door swung open.</p><p>My! Such a scramble! The dolls piled over one another in their desire to be the first at the goodies.</p><p>They swarmed upon the pantry shelves and in their eagerness spilled a pitcher of cream which ran all over the French dolly\u2019s dress.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1c-tb.jpg'></img><p>The Indian doll found some corn bread and dipping it in the molasses he sat down for a good feast.</p><p>A jar of raspberry jam was overturned and the dollies ate of this until their faces were all purple.</p><p>The tin soldier fell from the shelf three times and bent one of his tin legs, but he scrambled right back up again.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1d-tb.jpg'></img><p>Never had the dolls had so much fun and excitement, and they had all eaten their fill when they heard the click of the front gate.</p><p>They did not take time to climb from the shelves, but all rolled or jumped off to the floor and scrambled back to their room as fast as they could run, leaving a trail of bread crumbs and jam along the way.</p><p>Just as their mistress came into the room the dolls dropped in whatever positions they happened to be in.</p><p>\u201cThis is funny!\u201d cried Mistress. \u201cThey were all left sitting in their places around the room! I wonder if Fido has been shaking them up!\u201d Then she saw Raggedy Ann\u2019s face and picked her up. \u201cWhy Raggedy Ann, you are all sticky! I do believe you are covered with jam!\u201d and Mistress tasted Raggedy Ann\u2019s hand. \u201cYes! It\u2019s JAM! Shame on you, Raggedy Ann! You\u2019ve been in the pantry and all the others, too!\u201d and with this the dolls\u2019 mistress dropped Raggedy Ann on the floor and left the room.</p><p>When she came back she had on an apron and her sleeves were rolled up.</p><p>She picked up all the sticky dolls and putting them in a basket she carried them out under the apple tree in the garden.</p><p>There she had placed her little tub and wringer and she took the dolls one at a time, and scrubbed them with a scrubbing brush and soused them up and down and this way and that in the soap suds until they were clean.</p><p>Then she hung them all out on the clothes-line in the sunshine to dry.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1c2.jpg'></img><p>There the dolls hung all day, swinging and twisting about as the breeze swayed the clothes-line.</p><p>\u201cI do believe she scrubbed my face so hard she wore off my smile!\u201d said Raggedy Ann, after an hour of silence.</p><p>\u201cNo, it is still there!\u201d said the tin solder, as the wind twisted him around so he could see Raggedy. \u201cBut I do believe my arms will never work without squeaking, they feel so rusted,\u201d he added.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1e-tb.jpg'></img><p>Just then the wind twisted the little Dutch doll and loosened his clothes-pin, so that he fell to the grass below with a sawdusty bump and as he rolled over he said, \u201cMamma!\u201d in a squeaky voice.</p><p>Late in the afternoon the back door opened and the little mistress came out with a table and chairs. After setting the table she took all the dolls from the line and placed them about the table.</p><p>They had lemonade with grape jelly in it, which made it a beautiful lavender color, and little \u201cBaby-teeny-weeny-cookies\u201d with powdered sugar on them.</p><p>After this lovely dinner, the dollies were taken in the house, where they had their hair brushed and nice clean nighties put on.</p><p>Then they were placed in their beds and Mistress kissed each one good night and tiptoed from the room.</p><p>All the dolls lay as still as mice for a few minutes, then Raggedy Ann raised up on her cotton-stuffed elbows and said: \u201cI have been thinking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSh!\u201d said all the other dollies, \u201cRaggedy has been thinking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Raggedy Ann, \u201cI have been thinking; our mistress gave us the nice dinner out under the trees to teach us a lesson. She wished us to know that we could have had all the goodies we wished, whenever we wished, if we had behaved ourselves. And our lesson was that we must never take without asking what we could always have for the asking! So let us all remember and try never again to do anything which might cause those who love us any unhappiness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us all remember,\u201d chimed all the other dollies.</p><p>And Raggedy Ann, with a merry twinkle in her shoe-button eyes, lay back in her little bed, her cotton head filled with thoughts of love and happiness.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/s1f-tb.jpg'></img>"}
