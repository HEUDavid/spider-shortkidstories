Around Ozma\u2019s throne, on such occasions, are grouped all the important personages of Oz, such as the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, Tiktok the Clockwork Man, the Tin Woodman, the Wizard of Oz, the Shaggy Man and other famous fairy people. Little Dorothy usually has a seat at Ozma\u2019s feet, and crouched on either side the throne are two enormous beasts known as the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image4.jpg'></img><p>These two beasts are Ozma\u2019s chief guardians, but as everyone loves the beautiful girl Princess there has never been any disturbance in the great Throne Room, or anything for the guardians to do but look fierce and solemn and keep quiet until the Royal Audience is over and the people go away to their homes.</p><p>Of course no one would dare be naughty while the huge Lion and Tiger crouched beside the throne; but the fact is, the people of Oz are very seldom naughty. So Ozma\u2019s big guards are more ornamental than useful, and no one realizes that better than the beasts themselves.</p><p>One day, after everybody had left the Throne Room except the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Lion yawned and said to his friend:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this job. No one is afraid of us and no one pays any attention to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d replied the big Tiger, purring softly. \u201cWe might as well be in the thick jungles where we were born, as trying to protect Ozma when she needs no protection. And I\u2019m dreadfully hungry all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have enough to eat, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said the Lion, swaying his tail slowly back and forth.</p><p>\u201cEnough, perhaps; but not the kind of food I long for,\u201d answered the Tiger. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hungry for is fat babies. I have a great desire to eat a few fat babies. Then, perhaps, the people of Oz would fear me and I\u2019d become more important.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image5.jpg'></img><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d agreed the Lion. \u201cIt would stir up quite a rumpus if you ate but one fat baby. As for myself; my claws are sharp as needles and strong as crowbars, while my teeth are powerful enough to tear a person to pieces in a few seconds. If I should spring upon a man and make chop suey of him, there would be wild excitement in the Emerald City and the people would fall upon their knees and beg me for mercy. That, in my opinion, would render me of considerable importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you had torn the person to pieces, what would you do next?\u201d asked the Tiger sleepily.</p><p>\u201cThen I would roar so loudly it would shake the earth and stalk away to the jungle to hide myself, before anyone could attack me or kill me for what I had done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d nodded the Tiger. \u201cYou are really cowardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure. That is why I am named the Cowardly Lion. That is why I have always been so tame and peaceable. But I\u2019m awfully tired of being tame,\u201d added the Lion, with a sigh, \u201cand it would be fun to raise a row and show people what a terrible beast I really am.\u201d The Tiger remained silent for several minutes, thinking deeply as he slowly washed his face with his left paw. Then he said:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting old, and it would please me to eat at least one fat baby before I die. Suppose we surprise these people of Oz and prove our power. What do you say? We will walk out of here just as usual and the first baby we meet I\u2019ll eat in a jiffy, and the first man or woman you meet you will tear to pieces. Then we will both run out of the city gates and gallop across the country and hide in the jungle before anyone can stop us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right; I\u2019m game,\u201d said the Lion, yawning again so that he showed two rows of dreadfully sharp teeth.</p><p>The Tiger got up and stretched his great, sleek body.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. The Lion stood up and proved he was the larger of the two, for he was almost as big as a small horse.</p><p>Out of the palace they walked, and met no one. They passed through the beautiful grounds, past fountains and beds of lovely flowers, and met no one. Then they unlatched a gate and entered a street of the city, and met no one.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how a fat baby will taste,\u201d remarked the Tiger, as they stalked majestically along, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it will taste like nutmegs,\u201d said the Lion.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said the Tiger, \u201cI\u2019ve an idea it will taste like gumdrops.\u201d</p><p>They turned a corner, but met no one, for the people of the Emerald City were accustomed to take their naps at this hour of the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how many pieces I ought to tear a person into,\u201d said the Lion, in a thoughtful voice.</p><p>\u201cSixty would be about right,\u201d suggested the Tiger.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image6.jpg'></img><p>\u201cWould that hurt any more than to tear one into about a dozen pieces?\u201d inquired the Lion, with a little shudder.</p><p>\u201cWho cares whether it hurts or not?\u201d growled the Tiger.</p><p>The Lion did not reply. They entered a side street, but met no one.</p><p>Suddenly they heard a child crying.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed the Tiger. \u201cThere is my meat.\u201d</p><p>He rushed around a corner, the Lion following, and came upon a nice fat baby sitting in the middle of the street and crying as if in great distress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked the Tiger, crouching before the baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I-lost my m-m-mamma!\u201d wailed the baby.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you poor little thing,\u201d said the great beast, softly stroking the child\u2019s head with its paw. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, my dear, for mamma can\u2019t be far away and I\u2019ll help you to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d said the Lion, who stood by.</p><p>\u201cGo on where?\u201d asked the Tiger, looking up.</p><p>\u201cGo on and eat your fat baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you dreadful creature!\u201d said the Tiger reproachfully; \u201cwould you want me to eat a poor little lost baby, that doesn\u2019t know where its mother is?\u201d And the beast gathered the little one into its strong, hairy arms and tried to comfort it by rocking it gently back and forth.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image7.jpg'></img><p>The Lion growled low in his throat and seemed very much disappointed; but at that moment a scream reached their ears and a woman came bounding out of a house and into the street. Seeing her baby in the embrace of the monster Tiger the woman screamed again and rushed forward to rescue it, but in her haste she caught her foot in her skirt and tumbled head over heels and heels over head, stopping with such a bump that she saw many stars in the heavens, although it was broad daylight. And there she lay, in a helpless manner, all tangled up and unable to stir.</p><p>With one bound and a roar like thunder the huge Lion was beside her. With his strong jaws he grasped her dress and raised her into an upright position.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image8.jpg'></img><p>\u201cPoor thing! Are you hurt?\u201d he gently asked.</p><p>Gasping for breath the woman struggled to free herself and tried to walk, but she limped badly and tumbled down again.</p><p>\u201cMy baby!\u201d she said pleadingly.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is all right; don\u2019t worry,\u201d replied the Lion; and then he added: \u201cKeep quiet, now, and I\u2019ll carry you back to your house, and the Hungry Tiger will carry your baby.\u201d</p><p>The Tiger, who had approached the place with the child in its arms, asked in astonishment:</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tear her into sixty pieces?\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image9.jpg'></img><p>\u201cNo, nor into six pieces,\u201d answered the Lion indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m not such a brute as to destroy a poor woman who has hurt herself trying to save her lost baby. If you are so ferocious and cruel and bloodthirsty, you may leave me and go away, for I do not care to associate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d answered the Tiger. \u201cI\u2019m not cruel\u2014not in the least\u2014I\u2019m only hungry. But I thought you were cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heaven I\u2019m respectable,\u201d said the Lion, with dignity. He then raised the woman and with much gentleness carried her into her house, where he laid her upon a sofa. The Tiger followed with the baby, which he safely deposited beside its mother. The little one liked the Hungry Tiger and grasping the enormous beast by both ears the baby kissed the beast\u2019s nose to show he was grateful and happy.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said the woman. \u201cI\u2019ve often heard what good beasts you are, in spite of your power to do mischief to mankind, and now I know that the stories are true. I do not think either of you have ever had an evil thought.\u201d</p><p>The Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion hung their heads and did not look into each other\u2019s eyes, for both were shamed and humbled. They crept away and stalked back through the streets until they again entered the palace grounds, where they retreated to the pretty, comfortable rooms they occupied at the back of the palace. There they silently crouched in their usual corners to think over their adventure.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image10.jpg'></img><p>After a while the Tiger said sleepily:</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe fat babies taste like gumdrops. I\u2019m quite sure they have the flavor of raspberry tarts. My, how hungry I am for fat babies!\u201d</p><p>The Lion grunted disdainfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a humbug,\u201d said he.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d retorted the Tiger, with a sneer. \u201cTell me, then, into how many pieces you usually tear your victims, my bold Lion?\u201d</p><p>The Lion impatiently thumped the floor with his tail.</p><p>\u201cTo tear anyone into pieces would soil my claws and blunt my teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t muss myself up this afternoon by hurting that poor mother.\u201d</p><p>The Tiger looked at him steadily and then yawned a wide, wide yawn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a coward,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cit\u2019s better to be a coward than to do wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure,\u201d answered the other. \u201cAnd that reminds me that I nearly lost my own reputation. For, had I eaten that fat baby I would not now be the Hungry Tiger. It\u2019s better to go hungry, seems to me, than to be cruel to a little child.\u201d</p><p>And then they dropped their heads on their paws and went to sleep.</p>"}
