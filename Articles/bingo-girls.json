The girls were very excited and anxious to go and play one of their favorite board games.</p><p>Ivy Melissa told her sister, Jamie Lynne, that in order to get good seats for the game (those seats that were closest to the BINGO WALL BOARD), they would have to get to the firehouse by 9:00 am. It was already 8:45 and Jamie Lynne wasn\u2019t ready yet.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Jamie, Hurry up or we\u2019ll never make it,\u201d Ivy Melissa yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished tying my shoelaces, Ivy,\u201d Jamie Lynne answered. Then within 5 fast minutes, both girls had said their good-byes to their mother, and had raced out the door and down the block.</p><p>The girls reached the line of Bingo-goers at the firehouse by about 8:59 am.</p><p>\u201cWhew, we just made it, Ivy Melissa,\u201d said Jamie Lynne.</p><p>\u201cNow I hope that we can win a game and get one of those great toy prizes,\u201d Ivy Melissa said with excitement in her voice.</p><p>Soon the firehouse door opened up wide, and Ivy Melissa and Jamie Lynne hurriedly walked into the big hall and got good seats down front near the BINGO WALL BOARD. They picked out 5 boards each and scooped up a handful of chips to put down on the numbers. They waited with all the other kids for the games to begin and got their boards ready for play.</p><p>The time came, and the caller started the first game.</p><p>\u201cB-12,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cI HAVE IT!, Ivy Melissa,\u201d Jamie Lynne yelled.</p><p>\u201cNot so LOUD, Jamie Lynne,\u201d Ivy Melissa whispered back to her sister. \u201cDon\u2019t yell out until you have 5 numbers in a row, up and down, across or diagonally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Jamie Lynne, \u201cbut I hope I WIN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to win, too,\u201d Ivy Melissa told her, \u201cbut there can only be a certain amount of winners per game. If we don\u2019t win, we don\u2019t win. But at least we will have fun!\u201d</p><p>The games continued. Ivy Melissa won one game (diagonally) and her prize was a toy pony. Jamie Lynne needed one number on each of the first 5 games played. She was getting very frustrated.</p><p>\u201cI wish we had never COME to this dumb BINGO game, Ivy Melissa. At least YOU won a prize; I didn\u2019t win..I just keep waiting and waiting for l NUMBER! When is it going to be MY turn to win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jamie Lynne, just try to have fun. Maybe this last big JACKPOT game will be the one you win,\u201d Ivy Melissa said, trying to comfort her little sister. \u201cJust keep playing and let\u2019s wait and see. Let\u2019s put it this way: If you don\u2019t win this last game, I promise to let you play with my prize pony. Okay?? Okay. Now let\u2019s listen to the numbers.\u201d</p><p>The caller began\u2026 \u201cG-54\u2026..I-17\u2026.0-75\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have those numbers, Ivy Melissa. Do you think I\u2019m going to get my B-3 and N-36?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh. Just listen\u2026Don\u2019t talk, Jamie Lynne.\u201d</p><p>The caller continued..\u201dB-4\u2026.G-46\u2026.B-3\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, Ivy, LOOK..I only need N-36, and I win the big JACKPOT game!\u201d</p><p>The caller slowly (or it SEEMED to be slowly) said \u201cN-36.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBINGO! BINGO! I HAVE BINGO!\u201d screamed Jamie Lynne.</p><p>\u201cBINGO!\u201d called out another girl\u2019s voice from the back of the firehouse.</p><p>\u201cCall out your numbers, loud and clear,\u201d said the caller.</p><p>\u201cB-3,I-17,N-36,G-54 and 0-75,\u201d said Jamie Lynne in a loud, proud voice. The girl from the back of the firehouse hall gave the same numbers.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said the caller, \u201clooks like we have 2 winners for the JACKPOT game. Tell you what. Will the 2 girls who won, please come up to the front, and pick out 4 toys of your own choice. Whatever you choose, you keep as your prize.\u201d</p><p>Jamie Lynne and the other girl each picked out baby dolls, books, doll clothing and painting sets. Jamie Lynne ran back to her sister. Ivy Melissa gave her little sister a congratulations-type of hug. The 2 BINGO GIRLS hurried home to show their mother what they had won.</p><p>\u201cBoy, Ivy Melissa, didn\u2019t we have FUN?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Jamie Lynne. B-I-N-G-O was G-R-E-A-T!!!!\u201d</p>"}
