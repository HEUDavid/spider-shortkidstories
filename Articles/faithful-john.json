If you do not promise to instruct him in everything he ought to know, and to be his guardian, I cannot close my eyes in peace.\u201d</p><p>Then John answered, \u201cI will never leave him; I will always serve him truly, even if it costs me my life.\u201d So the old King was comforted, and said, \u201cNow I can die in peace. After my death you must show him all the chambers, halls, and vaults in the castle, and all the treasures which are in them; but the last room in the long corridor you must not show him, for in it hangs the painting of the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace; if he sees her picture, he will immediately have a great love for her, and because of her account undergo great dangers, therefore you must keep him away.\u201d</p><p>The faithful John pressed his master\u2019s hand again to show he agreed to do it, and soon after the King laid his head upon the pillow and passed away.</p><p>After the old King had been buried, the faithful John told to the young King all that his father had said upon his death-bed, and declared, \u201cAll this I will certainly do; I will be as true to you as I was to him.\u201d</p><p>When the time of mourning was passed, John said to the young King, \u201cIt is now time for you to see your inheritance; I will show you your father\u2019s castle.\u201d So he led the King all over it, upstairs and downstairs, and showed him all the riches, and all the splendid chambers; only one room he did not open, containing the dangerous painting, which was so placed that one saw it directly the door was opened, and, moreover, it was so beautifully painted that one thought it breathed and moved; nothing in all the world could be more lifelike or more beautiful. The young King remarked, however, that the faithful John always passed by one door, so he asked, \u201cWhy do you not open that one?\u201d \u201cThere is something in it,\u201d he replied, \u201cwhich will frighten you.\u201d</p><p>But the King said, \u201cI have seen all the rest of the castle, and I will know what is in there,\u201d and he went and tried to open the door by force. The faithful John pulled him back, and said, \u201cI promised your father before he died that you should not see the contents of that room; it would bring great misfortunes both upon you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d replied the young King, \u201cif I do not go in it will be my certain ruin; I should have no peace night nor day until I had seen it with my own eyes. Now I will not stir from the place till you unlock the door.\u201d</p><p>Then the faithful John saw that it was of no use talking; so, with a heavy heart and many sighs, he picked the key out of the great bunch. When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought he would cover up the picture, that the King should not see it; but it was of no use, for the King stepped upon tiptoes and looked over his shoulder; and as soon as he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so beautiful and glittered with precious stones, he fell down on the ground. The faithful John lifted him up and carried him to his bed, and thought with great concern, \u201cMercy on us! the misfortune has happened; what will come of it?\u201d and he gave the young King wine until he came to himself. The first words he spoke were, \u201cWho does that beautiful picture represent?\u201d \u201cThat is the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace,\u201d was the reply.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d said the King, \u201cmy love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues, they should not deny it; my life is set upon the search for her. You are my faithful John, you must accompany me.\u201d</p><p>The trusty servant deliberated for a long while how to set about this business, for it was very difficult to get into the presence of the King\u2019s daughter. At last he thought of a way, and said it to the King.</p><p>\u201cEverything which she has around her is of gold\u2014chairs, tables, dishes, bowls, and all the household utensils. Among your treasures are five tons of gold; let one of the goldsmiths of your kingdom make vessels and utensils of all kinds from it \u2014all kinds of birds, and wild and wonderful beasts, such as will please her, then we will travel with these, and try our luck.\u201d</p><p>Then the King summoned all his goldsmiths, who worked day and night until many very beautiful things were ready. When all had been placed on board a ship, the faithful John put on merchant\u2019s clothes, and the King likewise, so that they might travel quite unknown. Then they sailed over the wide sea, and sailed away until they came to the city where dwelt the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/105.png'></img><p>The faithful John told the King to remain in the ship, and wait for him. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said he, \u201cI shall bring the King\u2019s daughter with me; therefore take care that all is in order, and set out the golden vessels and adorn the whole ship.\u201d</p><p>John then placed in a napkin some of the golden cups, stepped upon land, and went straight to the King\u2019s palace. When he came into the castle yard, a beautiful maid stood by the brook, who had two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water; and when she had filled them and had turned round, she saw a strange man, and asked who he was. Then John answered, \u201cI am a merchant\u201d; and opening his napkin he showed her its contents.</p><p>She exclaimed, \u201cOh, what beautiful golden things!\u201d and, setting the buckets down, she looked at the cups one after another, and said, \u201cThe King\u2019s daughter must see these; she is so pleased with anything made of gold that she will buy all these.\u201d And taking him by the hand, she led him in; for she was the lady\u2019s maid.</p><p>When the King\u2019s daughter saw the golden cups, she was much pleased, and said, \u201cThey are so finely worked that I will purchase them all.\u201d But the faithful John replied, \u201cI am only the servant of a rich merchant; what I have here is nothing in comparison to those which my master has in his ship, than which nothing more delicate or costly has ever been worked in gold.\u201d</p><p>Then the King\u2019s daughter wished to have them all brought; but he said, \u201cIt would take many days, and so great is the quantity that your palace has not halls enough in it to place them around.\u201d Then her curiosity and desire were still more excited, and at last she said, \u201cTake me to the ship; I will go myself and look at your master\u2019s treasure.\u201d</p><p>The faithful John conducted her to the ship with great joy, and the King, when he saw her, saw that her beauty was still greater than the picture had represented, and thought nothing else but that his heart would jump out of his mouth. Presently she stepped on board, and the King conducted her below; but the faithful John remained on deck by the steersman, and told him to unmoor the ship and put on all the sail he could, that it might fly as a bird through the air. Meanwhile the King showed the Princess all the golden treasures\u2014the dishes, cups, bowls, the birds, the wild and wonderful beasts.</p><p>Many hours passed away while she looked at everything, and in her joy she did not remark that the ship sailed on and on. As soon as she had looked at the last, and thanked the merchant, she wished to depart. But when she came on deck, she perceived that they were upon the high sea, far from the shore, and were hastening on with all sail. \u201cAh,\u201d she exclaimed in a fright, \u201cI am betrayed; I am carried off and taken away in the power of a strange merchant. I would rather die!\u201d</p><p>But the King, taking her by the hand, said, \u201cI am not a merchant, but a king, your equal in birth. It is true that I have carried you off; but that is because of my overwhelming love for you. Do you know that when I first saw the portrait of your beautiful face I fell down in a faint before it?\u201d</p><p>When the King\u2019s daughter heard these words, she was reassured, and her heart was inclined toward him, so that she willingly became his bride. While they thus went on their voyage on the high sea, it happened that the faithful John, as he sat on the deck of the ship, playing music, saw three crows in the air, who came flying toward them. He stopped playing, and listened to what they were saying to each other, for he understood them perfectly. The first one exclaimed, \u201cThere he is, carrying home the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace.\u201d \u201cBut he is not home yet,\u201d replied the second. \u201cBut he has her,\u201d said the third; \u201cshe is sitting by him in the ship.\u201d</p><p>Then the first began again, and exclaimed, \u201cWhat does that matter? When they go on shore a fox-colored horse will spring toward them, on which he will mount; and as soon as he is on it, it will jump up with him into the air, so that he will never again see his bride.\u201d</p><p>The second one asked, \u201cIs there no escape?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, if another mounts behind quickly, and takes out the firearms which are in the holster, and with them shoots the horse, then the young King will be saved. But who knows that? And if any one does know it, and tells him, such a one will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee.\u201d</p><p>Then the second spoke again, \u201cI know still more: if the horse should be killed, the young King will not then keep his bride; for when they come into the castle a beautiful bridal shirt will lie there upon a dish, and seem to be woven of gold and silver, but it is enchanted, and if he puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.\u201d Then the third Crow asked, \u201cIs there no escape?\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d answered the second, \u201cif some one takes up the shirt with his glove on, and throws it into the fire, so that it is burnt, the young King will be saved. But what does that signify? Whoever knows it, and tells him, will be turned to stone from his knee to his heart.\u201d</p><p>Then the third Crow spoke: \u201cI know still more: even if the bridal shirt be consumed, still the young King will not retain his bride. For if, after the wedding, a dance is held, while the young Queen dances she will suddenly turn pale, and fall down as if dead; and if some one does not raise her up, and take three drops of blood from her right breast and throw them away, she will die. But whoever knows that, and tells it, will have his whole body turned to stone, from the crown of his head to the toes of his feet.\u201d</p><p>After the crows had thus talked with one another, they flew away, and the trusty John, who had perfectly understood all they had said, was from that time very quiet and sad; for if he kept\u00a0 from his master what he had heard, misfortune would happen to him, and if he told him all he must give up his own life. But at last he thought, \u201cI will save my master, even if I destroy myself.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they came on shore, it happened just as the Crow had foretold, and an immense fox-red horse sprang up. \u201cGreat!\u201d said the King, \u201cthis shall carry me to my castle,\u201d and he tried to mount; but the faithful John came straight up, and swinging himself quickly on, drew the gun out of the holster and shot the horse dead. Then the other servants of the King, who were not on good terms with the faithful John, exclaimed, \u201cHow shameful to kill the beautiful creature, which might have borne the King to the castle!\u201d But the King replied, \u201cBe silent, and let him go; he is my very faithful John\u2014who knows the good he may have done?\u201d</p><p>Now they went into the castle, and there stood a dish in the hall, and the splendid bridal shirt lay in it, and seemed nothing else than gold and silver. The young King went up to it and wished to take it up, but the faithful John pushed him away, and taking it up with his gloves on, bore it quickly to the fire and let it burn. The other servants thereupon began to murmur, saying, \u201cSee, now he is burning the King\u2019s bridal shirt!\u201d But the young King replied, \u201cWho knows what good he has done? Let him alone\u2014he is my faithful John.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/109.png'></img><p>Soon after, the wedding was celebrated, and a grand ball was given, and the bride began to dance. So the faithful John paid great attention, and watched her countenance; all at once she grew pale, and fell as if dead to the ground. Then he sprang up hastily, raised her up and bore her to a chamber, where he laid her down, kneeled beside her, and drawing the three drops of blood out of her right breast, threw them away.</p><p>As soon as she breathed again, she raised herself up; but the young King had witnessed everything, and not knowing why the faithful John had done this was very angry, and called out, \u201cThrow him into prison!\u201d</p><p>The next morning the trusty John was brought up for trial.\u00a0 As he stood up before them, he said, \u201cEvery one condemned to die may once before his death speak. Shall I also have that privilege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered the King, \u201cit shall be granted you.\u201d Then the faithful John replied, \u201cI have been unfairly judged, and have always been true to you\u201d; and he repeated the conversation of the crows which he heard at sea; and how, in order to save his master, he was obliged to do all he had done. Then the King cried out, \u201cOh, my most trusty John, pardon, pardon; lead him away!\u201d But the trusty John had fallen down at the last word and was turned into stone.</p><p>At this event both the King and the Queen were in great grief, and the King thought, \u201cAh, how wickedly have I rewarded his great loyalty!\u201d and he had the stone statue raised up and placed in his bedroom, near his bed; and as often as he looked at it, he wept and said, \u201cAh, could I bring you back to life again, my faithful John!\u201d</p><p>After some time had passed, the Queen had twins, two little sons, who were her great joy. Once, when the Queen was in church, and the two children at home playing by their father\u2019s side, he looked up at the stone statue full of sorrow, and exclaimed with a sigh, \u201cAh, could I restore you to life, my faithful John!\u201d</p><p>At these words the statue began to speak, saying, \u201cYes, you can make me alive again, if you will give me that which is dearest to you.\u201d The King replied, \u201cAll that I have in the world I will give up for you.\u201d</p><p>The statue spoke again: \u201cIf your two children hug me one after he other,\u00a0 I shall be brought to life again.\u201d The King agreed and as soon as the second child had finished hugging the statue, life came back to it, and the trusty John stood again alive and well before him.</p><p>Now the King was full of happiness, and as soon as he saw the Queen coming, he hid the faithful John and both the children in a great closet. As soon as she came in he said to her, \u201cHave you prayed in the church?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered; \u201cbut I thought continually of the faithful John, who has come to such misfortune through us.\u201d Then he went up to the closet, unlocked it, brought out the children and the faithful John, saying, \u201cGod be praised! he is saved, and\u00a0 told her all that happened. Afterward they lived happily together to the end of their days.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/111.png'></img>"}
