But unlike me, forty-seven pounds and underweight at eight years old, Monica had extra meat on her bones. \u00a0She was not fat. \u00a0She just had something boys our age went crazy for, something I lacked in.\u00a0 Boobs.</p><p>\u201cMy sister,\u201d Monica said to me at recess one day, \u201csays that at our age, we are supposed to start growing a set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we don\u2019t\u2026you know get them\u2026at all\u2026\u201d I sounded like a tiny rabbit lost in the woods.</p><p>Monica stared at me with her baby blue eyes, a sight that made the boys bat their own eyelashes, before she said with that stern tone like my mom\u2019s, \u201cLike I said, at our age, we are supposed to.\u201d</p><p>I had to use the bathroom.\u00a0 My eyes watered up and Monica had noticed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I lied.\u00a0 \u00a0I must have stayed in that locked stall for a good ten minutes, crying.</p><p>Monica was suspended a few weeks later when she had flashed her set of twins to a boy of our age during recess one day, behind the baseball field bathrooms.\u00a0 But he did not show his.</p><p>I stood guard with the boy\u2019s best friend, Antonio,\u00a0 who was also pretty white for a Mexican such as myself. \u00a0Monica also pointed out how she looked more \u201cMexican\u201d than me. Antonio was the first to strike up a conversation. \u00a0He went on and on about last night\u2019s math homework\u2014division. \u00a0I nodded like I was listening. \u00a0He annoyed the heck out of my poor little burning red ears.</p><p>Before either of us knew, we had company. \u201cWhat are you two doing over here?\u201d It was Mrs. Affleck, one of the second grade teachers, giving us a fright and making us leap inches off the floor.</p><p>We were all sent to the front office. \u00a0The lady who always answers the phones called our parents. \u00a0The boy who saw Monica\u2019s boobs burst into tears as soon as his mom stormed into the building and dragged him out to the car. \u00a0Once they were outside, I saw her grabbing a hold of his ear. \u00a0Antonio and I were let off of the hook, since we actually never saw anything. \u00a0We were ordered to report back to class.</p><p>Before I walked away, Monica stood up.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d I nearly bawled because her hands squeezed around my wrists.</p><p>\u201cCall me later,\u201d she said. \u00a0It was weird\u2026she looked me dead in the eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I will!\u201d I winced and pulled away from her. \u00a0My wrists scorched like fire, turning redder by the second.\u00a0 Tears swirled in Monica\u2019s eyes. \u201cPromise,\u201d I said a moment later.</p><p>Then, as though on cue, her parents stormed in and screamed, mostly at Monica, using curse words and telling her how disappointed they were to learn of her behavior. \u00a0That last one, \u201cYou\u2019re a disappointment to the family,\u201d hit home for Monica.\u00a0 She followed her parents without a sound. \u00a0I was amazed how she listened to them instead of stirring up a fight. \u00a0Each parent had a firm hold of her wrists.</p><p>What gets me was the fact that Monica never cried\u2014at all. \u00a0I waited by the house phone for what seemed like hours. \u00a0I jumped to my feet whenever the telephone rang.</p><p>\u201cNot for you, Katie,\u201d my mom or dad informed me.</p><p>But when it was Monica who finally called, \u201cKatie,\u201d she said from the other line, \u201cdid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I did, but it could not be true.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving, Katie,\u201d she repeated. \u201cFor good.\u201d</p><p>Then she burst into tears, and so did I. \u00a0We spoke for a few more minutes, until her dad\u00a0shouted, \u201cBED!\u201d</p><p>It has been over a year since Monica and I last spoke. \u00a0It used to make me very sad to the point where I cried myself asleep. \u00a0It was like she died or something worse, which made me cry even more. I always choked on my own tears. \u00a0It worried my parents, who were tempted to send\u00a0me off to a shrink (guess that is a bad thing since \u201cshrink\u201d was always whispered in our house).</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s only a child,\u201d I overheard my parents argue to each other.</p><p>Eventually,\u00a0 I felt better.\u00a0 \u00a0I woke up a few minutes before my mom \u00a0came into my bedroom to wake me up for the day. \u00a0I functioned and attended school, completed homework and ate dinner every night with my parents and older sister, Luz, without bursting into tears. \u00a0I assumed it was just a phase\u2026at least that was what my parents informed me.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d my mom said to me one night, \u201cnot all of your friends are meant to be in your life forever.\u00a0 People come and go.\u201d</p><p>Luz once told me that I could just sit and wonder why this or that happened or turn to God and pray about my anger, sadness or whatever is bothering me. \u201cGod has better and bigger plans for each and every one of us.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah! \u00a0I forgot to mention my family is very religious\u2014all born and raised Catholic.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d my mom says as we pull up to the pickup/drop off zone, then she puts the\u00a0Suburban into park. \u201cHave a great day, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the passenger window at those bold burgundy letters imprinted atop the white building, where the stone staircase leads to Eagles Elementary School.\u00a0 \u00a0Today is the first day back, the first day of fourth grade.</p><p>Monica was my only friend here.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I can already sense their eyes on me, but my mom says I am just being paranoid. \u00a0As we pull up into the line of cars where kids my age and older exit with backpacks, lunch boxes and even projects, my mom turns to me and says, \u201cNicole, you\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p><p>Biting my nails. \u00a0Oh how much my mom despises when I do that. \u00a0She always says that boys hate when girls\u2014especially my age\u2014bite their fingernails like it is made out of taffy. \u201cBut taffy is GOOD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole\u2026\u201d</p><p>I take a few more nibbles, until she yanks my hand away from my mouth. \u00a0Being a multi tasker as well, she puts the Honda into park. \u00a0She turns to me, but I only stare out the passenger window, watching student after student roam the grounds. \u00a0That weird feeling comes back to the pit of my stomach like, I ate something sour and spicy.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d my mom says lightly, \u201cyou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s starting their first\u00a0day.\u00a0 There will be other kids who are in the same spot as you today.\u00a0 So\u2026\u201d</p><p>I say nothing, but I feel my eyes enlarge as they jump from person to person\u2026groups of students\u2026all with friends.</p><p>\u201cI can go in with you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>And my expression said it all.</p><p>My mom and I squeeze through the crowd, as I tug a hold of my backpack straps like I am about to take off into the sky. \u00a0We make our way to the front office. \u00a0Before I know it, we are at the counter where there are many elderly women with salt and pepper hairdos. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d my mom said all businessy, as if she was at an interview, and sets my school schedule down onto\u00a0the counter. \u201cMy daughter, Nicole, is new here, and I was just wondering if anyone could show her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom 20 is around the corner,\u201d one of the women says and slides a sheet of paper in front of us. \u00a0It is a school map. \u201cBut, she\u2019ll have to find help or find the room herself. \u00a0Our staff blocks off all classrooms until the bell rings. \u00a0Everyone waits in the cafeteria until they\u2019re excused.\u201d</p><p>And I am right, people look at me. \u00a0A girl with frizzy red hair and her circle of friends giggle and turn away from our direction.\u00a0\u00a0 A boy with jet black hair circles around the nearby pillar and sits back down with his friends, who all do a double\u2014for some a triple\u2014take on me.</p><p>This is so embarrassing. Nobody else is standing with their mom. \u00a0Just me. \u00a0I want to cry right here.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d my mom starts up as we approach an empty table in the back of the outdoor cafeteria, which has a blue and white theme, \u201csome kids are just rude. \u00a0Not offering to help you out.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ever be like them, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all just a bunch of spoiled brats.\u201d</p><p>I notice there are a few parents present. \u00a0Several of them glance our way as if shooting laser beams out of their eyes. \u00a0When they see my mom looking their way, most of them turn their backs to us. \u00a0One couple even forces their son to move to a different table. \u00a0I just sit there, side by side with my mom, and sigh.\u00a0 This will be a long day.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d my mom starts up again, \u201cyou know how to read maps.\u00a0 \u00a0See that room right\u00a0there?\u201d</p><p>I nod\u2026on the verge\u2026no not now\u2026holding back the tears.</p><p>\u201cRight, um, well just follow that path here\u2026\u201d</p><p>As my mom goes on, thinking I am listening, I notice a new set of eyes on me from across the room.\u00a0 And she heads our way\u2026</p><p>Everything appears in slow motion as this skinny, short, pigtailed girl, who must be my age, stops at our table. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she squeaks. \u00a0It takes me a moment to realize that this is her real voice. \u201cI overheard you earlier about finding Room 20. \u00a0I have the same class.\u201d</p><p>My mom perks up and smiles, as does this strange girl. \u00a0On the other hand, I am too busy to notice anything but this girl\u2019s SpongeBob Squarepants themed backpack and metal lunch box. It makes me smile, because I have an I Love Lucy metal lunch box at home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Katie,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>That Nicole is sure a quiet one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicole,\u201d she says.</p><p>As soon as the bell rings for the day to begin, her mom, who Nicole definitely has the same Snow White skin and cherry lips, turns to me. \u201cTake care of my little Nicole. \u00a0Thank you for wanting to help her out.\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t I help out?</p><p>\u201cI just remember what it was like to be new myself.\u201d (Oh, did I ever).</p><p>On my first day of school at Eagles Elementary, as a first grader, I met Monica Ford. Our teacher, Ms. Gata, asked Monica if she could show me around the grounds. \u00a0To be honest, I do not know exactly how Monica and I became friends.\u00a0 \u00a0She was silent, until we passed by certain destinations. \u201cOver there are the bathrooms we use during lunch and the volleyball court. We can\u2019t pass that hill over there; they monitor us all around.\u201d</p><p>She kept talking and talking and would not shut up. \u00a0I was a ghost from there on out.</p><p>By the time Nicole\u2019s mom leaves and the rest of the student body heads off to class, I look at Nicole, who tightens her fingers around the bottom of her backpack straps. \u00a0There are waves of crinkles on her forehead, exactly like the ones my mom gets whenever she goes outside for a quick cigarette smoke. \u201cDon\u2019t tell dad,\u201d she always tells me.</p><p>\u201cI know I said that my name is Nicole,\u201d her voice tunes me back in, \u201cbut sometimes, people call me Nikki for short.\u201d</p><p>She is silent and gazes at me. \u00a0It takes me a moment to see her hand sticking out for a shake. \u00a0For whatever reason, I stare at it, like it belongs to Frankenstein, until, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>And we officially meet once we shake hands and head off to class.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I am tempted to say something else for a continuous conversation with this bubbly blonde hair creature, called Katie. \u00a0She guides me through another swarm of students, some of whom do a double take (I can feel their eyes peel and unpeel off of me), then directly to Room 20, where a line of our classmates already wait. \u201cHere we are,\u201d she says as we reach the back of the line.</p><p>I cannot help but squeeze harder onto the ends of my backpack straps (now it truly feels like I am about to skyrocket to the moon). \u00a0I can taste the sour and spicy bubbles in the back of my mouth. \u00a0Before I turn to vomit, a very pretty lady\u2014a spitting image of that one young starlet who won a bunch of awards for her work in that one film\u2014unlocks the door to Room 20.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mrs. Grimes,\u201d Katie fills me in, like we are on some secret top mission. \u201cFrom\u00a0what I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s super nice!\u00a0 And she loves Betty Boop and I Love Lucy\u2014a lot.\u201d</p><p>I cannot help but smile as Mrs. Grimes opens the door and kicks down the door stop to\u00a0our classroom.\u00a0 She welcomes us with a warm kind smile. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The first day of fourth grade is, pretty much, the same as any other first day of school. Since Mrs. Grimes announces that she has yet to assign us an actual seating chart, Nicole and I find empty desks in the back row of the tiny classroom. \u00a0Mrs. Grimes talks real fast (probably a mom and wife, too), but I catch the information about what we are going to learn this year. \u00a0I am pretty stoked about next semester\u2019s project of the wax museum figures. \u00a0It is a project that every student has to complete in order to graduate to the next class level. \u00a0I have seen the older kids do it before. \u00a0They dress up as a historical figure such as Abraham Lincoln or Amelia Earhart, and stand very still, until someone \u201cpushes\u201d a sticker that serves as a button on their costume. \u00a0Once their button is \u201cpushed,\u201d they give a speech in character and tell who they are, for what they are well known, and so forth. \u00a0Last year, I pushed a girl\u2019s button, and she perked up, and then spoke with a southern accent, \u201cI used to star on my own Disney Channel TV show. \u00a0Fun fact: I sang the show\u2019s theme song.\u201d \u00a0I forgot the name of the show.</p><p>Mrs. Grimes passes out a double-sided sheet of paper with questions that we are to answer individually. \u00a0She tells us to take our time, because, after all, we have only another three and a half hours until school comes to an end.\u00a0 The first day of school is always the shortest. \u00a0Luz promised she would take me to McDonalds later for a Happy Meal (I heard it comes with a Shrek action figure). \u00a0I take out a number two pencil, as Mrs. Grimes hands me a paper. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>I glance over to my left side and that small smile of mine immediately vanishes.</p><p>Nicole is as still as a boulder at the edge of a cliff. \u00a0Her hands are locked together, just sitting on top of her sheet of paper. \u00a0My eyes scan around and see the rest of our classmates are trying to stay awake. \u00a0Most are in a rush to answer the questions on the white sheet of paper.</p><p>With the temptation to speak, the words are on the tip of my tongue, until Nicole pulls out a blue pencil pouch from her backpack. \u00a0Next, she takes out a teal lead pencil, that has one of those gummy thingies on the grip, so one\u2019s hand will not hurt as they write. \u00a0Monica used to slip those gummy grips onto all of her pencils, complaining that her hand hurt.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Question 1: Name?</p><p>Nicole\u2026</p><p>I hesitate and think real hard on this one, until I jot down\u2026</p><p>De Los Reyes. Question 2: Age? Easy!</p><p>9 years old. Question 3: Birth date?</p><p>July 7th, 1992.</p><p>Yeah, that is right.</p><p>As I continue to answer the list of questions\u2014most ask about my favorite things such as books, movies, color and food\u2014I cannot stir away the thought of my dad.</p><p>Usually, I slept like a baby, but when I heard my bedroom door creak open one cold night\u2026 \u201cShh-shh,\u201d my dad said and sat at the edge of the bed.</p><p>I rubbed the sleepy dust out of my eyes. \u201cHi, dad.\u201d It was only moments before I saw the\u00a0suitcase at his feet. \u201cDaddy\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cDaddy\u2019s going away for a while\u2026\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>On cue, his forehead crunched up like an infant getting their monthly shots. \u00a0I sat up straighter; we found ourselves locked in a hug, holding on for dear life. \u00a0We remained in each other\u2019s arms for a while\u2014crying too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>And that was the last time I ever saw my dad, Ricardo Diaz. My parents never got along.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I stared at the clock on the wall that is above the shiny sink: the big hand struck the twelve. \u00a0YES! \u00a0It was now 11am. \u00a0So far, Mrs. Grimes went over math problems and before that, she showed us her former students\u2019 work as examples for our own upcoming projects. \u00a0But the only thing that stuck with me was the fact that Nicole had been extra quiet since Mrs. Grimes collected our questionnaires minutes ago. \u00a0I asked if she was okay and even tried to see what she put down for numbers seven and twelve, to get a laugh out of her; but nothing.</p><p>Nicole returned from the bathroom ten minutes after leaving.\u00a0 \u00a0Some heads, including Mrs. Grimes, turned to look; but most end up looking back at the overhead that projects our notes onto the white board. \u00a0I volunteered to show Nikki where the bathroom was, but Mrs. Grimes is one of those teachers who do not like to have friends tag along with each other during class session. \u00a0She is probably afraid that friends will never return to class. \u00a0After Nicole hung up the bathroom pass\u2014a big paddle with the words \u201cBathroom Pass \u2013 Room 20\u2014onto the door hook, she took her seat. \u00a0I caught Vicki, Sierra and Amy, who all look identical with their long red hair, as though they are part of a cult, shoot dirty looks at Nicole and snicker a bit.</p><p>But why? \u00a0She never did anything wrong to them. \u00a0In fact, she made no attempt to talk to anyone else, except for me. \u00a0Their behavior made me angry; and I saw my fingers curl into miniature boxing gloves.</p><p>Nicole sniffles, and the row in front of us, including myself since it tunes me back into present time, do a double take toward her; only, my eyes stay on her.\u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes are red and watery. \u00a0I glimpse around the room. \u00a0Everyone is at work and Mrs. Grimes continues to chatter\u00a0away about how to find the answer to question twelve. \u00a0Oops, I thought we were still on number eight.</p><p>Forget it. \u00a0I am already too far behind to scribble down the answers.\u00a0 So, I lean in and ask,</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d one of the cult girls in front of us says, with her finger against her lips.</p><p>I stick out my tongue as soon as the Manson girl turns away (I watched a two-hour documentary on the Manson girls\u2014and she like one of them).\u00a0 \u00a0At first, I am unaware that sticking out my tongue actually makes Nicole chuckle. \u201cNow I\u2019m okay,\u201d she says with a nod and sniffles back the tears.</p><p>I smile back.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Oh, goodie!\u00a0 \u00a0Only half an hour to go before the bell rings.\u00a0 \u00a0After my return from the bathroom, where I broke down in one of the stalls (thank God the bathroom was empty) I did not expect Katie and I to actually\u2026bond.</p><p>Math wraps up around 11am. \u00a0Mrs. Grimes takes the hint and stops talking, due to the many half shut eyes and pouty lips in the class she sees. \u00a0She calls it a day and pops in the movie, The Mouse and the Motorcycle.\u00a0 \u00a0Most of my classmates move to the back of the room for a better view of the TV, that hangs on the wall. \u00a0Katie and I laugh at the funny looking\u2014not to mention\u2014talking mouse.\u00a0 \u00a0The film receives a few gasps and \u201cewweeessss\u201d because of the cheesy special effects and the fact that a boy wants to befriend a mouse, named Ralph. \u00a0If I ever saw a talking mouse, I would run away and scream at the top of my lungs.</p><p>We are unable to finish the film due to time. \u00a0There are a few \u201cahhs\u201d when Mrs. Grimes ejects the video from the VCR. \u00a0The bell rings, and now my classmates holler and cheer. \u201cHip hip!\u201d a boy in a Godzilla T-shirt riots up.</p><p>\u201cHooray!\u201d the class chants back, including Katie and me, as we all walk out.</p><p>\u201cSee you all tomorrow!\u201d Mrs. Grimes shouts after us. \u00a0We all wave goodbye. \u201cHave a great rest of the day!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0For the first time, I notice her empty left ring finger (so not a wife\u2014 maybe not a mom either).</p><p>It must be a habit of mine\u2014assuming that all ladies are tied down\u2014as my mom once put\u00a0it, \u201cIf a woman is not married by a certain age\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0What happens?\u201d I had asked (all I needed to see was my mom\u2019s eyes roll). But, then again, my mom is also no longer married.</p><p>\u201cBye, Ms. Grimes,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Nicole and I follow additional students to the front of the school, where most parents already drive off after their sons or daughters hop into the cars. \u00a0A lot of students assemble into a line.\u00a0 \u00a0Two young workers, in matching navy blue collared shirts, guide the group to the after school day care, which is next to the main building. \u00a0Nicole and I are lost in conversation. \u00a0It is nice.</p><p>I ask, \u201cHave you read the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, at my other school, I did a report on Ramona and her Father. \u00a0I\u00a0really liked it.\u201d</p><p>I flinch.\u00a0 She reads\u2026for fun.</p><p>\u201cDo you read on your own time?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I try my best to not look so grossed out. \u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of books. \u00a0Though my sister says those Harry Potter books are good.\u201d</p><p>And, boy, does this get her chatty, as she goes on and on about how she read all of them. \u201cThere\u2019s another book coming out soon!\u201d Her best fan girl moment. \u201cLast time, my mom took me to the midnight arrivals at the book store. \u00a0I just love them!\u00a0 All of them!\u201d</p><p>We wait underneath the oak tree. \u00a0Nearby are a few other students; some stand alone. \u00a0I continue to listen. \u00a0But when she starts on the book character names, I cannot help but pitch in, \u201cThe Weasleys? \u00a0Hermione? \u00a0Harry? \u00a0At least, Ron is the most normal one\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s a wuss! \u00a0He freaks out over everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents big readers?\u201d I ask, to keep my fair share in the ongoing conversation. Bump! \u00a0She gets teary\u2014and blood\u2014red eyes again. \u00a0I cannot help but wince, ready to\u00a0spit out an apology, until\u2026\u201cKind of,\u201d she finally replies and gives a small sniffle. \u201cI sometimes\u00a0see my mom reading magazines, but that\u2019s pretty much it. \u00a0And\u2026\u201d She goes mute for a moment.</p><p>\u201c\u2026my dad\u2026\u201d</p><p>A car horn honks.</p><p>I lean in closer; but she struggles to speak; the words do not come out. \u00a0Then, another car\u00a0honk, followed by, \u201cNicole!\u201d</p><p>We see her business dressed mom, waiting in the line of cars at the drop off/pickup zone. My mom and sister drop me off and pick me up in this area too. \u00a0Nicole\u2019s mom waves at me along with her, \u201cHello.\u201d \u00a0I return the same gesture.</p><p>Nicole sighs and tugs onto her backpack straps. \u00a0Before she walks away, she turns her back to her mom, and then faces me. \u201cThank you. \u00a0I\u2019m really glad to have met you today.\u201d</p><p>I feel a warm feeling spread through me, like melted butter on homemade bread. \u201cYou\u00a0want to meet tomorrow?\u201d \u00a0It is all I can ask.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI\u2019d like that. \u00a0Where?\u201d \u201cHow about right here?\u201d</p><p>She scans around.\u00a0 \u00a0We both see her family van inching closer to the front of the line.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I repeat but with a smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>And off she goes, as I wait for my ride. \u00a0Before I know it, our family Honda pulls up into the driveway, at the back of the line. \u00a0I see Luz, who waves me over. \u00a0I grip nice and tight onto my belongings. \u00a0Mcdees </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>I jump into the passenger seat and buckle up. \u00a0When I look at my mom, whose eyes are on me like a hawk, my smile vanishes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>My mom smiles and puts the car back into drive. \u201cNothing,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just look\u00a0really happy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how my mom could just burst into tears\u2026but happy tears. \u00a0For the first time, I feel that way too. \u00a0I set a hand upon hers and return the hopeful smile. \u201cI have a feeling that things will get better.\u201d</p><p>Now, she really stifles back the tears and nods. \u201cMe too, baby. \u00a0Me too.\u201d</p><p>I look out the passenger window and catch a glimpse of Katie running by.\u00a0 \u00a0My eyes follow her over to a gray Honda, which pulls up directly behind our black Suburban.\u00a0 \u00a0As my mom waits for the cars in front of ours to leave, I gaze out the back window.</p><p>Katie buckles herself in, as she and the pretty brunette, of whom she looks exactly like a miniature version, exchange a few words. \u00a0Katie\u2019s eyes soon find mine, as my mom and Katie\u2019s sister both press their feet down onto the gas pedal and pull out into traffic.\u00a0\u00a0 We lead.\u00a0\u00a0 They follow us.\u00a0\u00a0 For a brief moment, it is just us two as though we are the only nine year olds on Earth. \u00a0Katie flashes her teeth at me; and I do the same before my mom makes a left turn, and they turn right. \u00a0We drive away and cut off a few other angry and impatient drivers, but even at a distance from that gray Honda, I know that Katie\u2019s eyes are still with mine.</p><p>Their horn blows. \u00a0I see Katie waving over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it,\u201d my mom\u00a0says, until, \u201cAlright, just once.\u201d</p><p>Beep!</p><p>But I keep my hand on the horn, laughing out every bit of joy that suddenly rushes over me. Usually, my mom would smack my hand away. \u00a0But this time, she just watches me and shakes her head with a small laugh.</p><p>It will all be alright.\u00a0 We will all be alright.</p>"}
