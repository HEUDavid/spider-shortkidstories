They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.</p><p>I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the \u201cFlopsy Bunnies.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image006-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>As there was not always quite enough to eat,\u2014Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy\u2019s brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image007-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image008-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor\u2019s garden.</p><p>Mr. McGregor\u2019s rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day\u2014oh joy!\u2014there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had \u201cshot\u201d into flower.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image009-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image010-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image011-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.</p><p>(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image012-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.</p><p>The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image013-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image014-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.</p><p>They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.</p><p>Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image015-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.</p><p>Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap\u2014</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\u201d said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image016-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.</p><p>He went to put away the mowing machine.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image017-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.</p><p>She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image018-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.</p><p>Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.</p><p>But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image019-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.</p><p>Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image020-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image021-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.</p><p>He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.</p><p>The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image022-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>The watched him go into his house.</p><p>And then they crept up to the window to listen.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image023-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.</p><p>They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle\u2014</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\u201d said Mr. McGregor.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image024-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>\u201cEh? What\u2019s that? What have they been spoiling now?\u201d enquired Mrs. McGregor.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\u201d repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers\u2014\u201done, two, three\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\u201d replied Mr. McGregor.</p><p>(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image025-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.</p><p>\u201cNot fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLine your old cloak?\u201d shouted Mr. McGregor\u2014\u201dI shall sell them and buy myself baccy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image026-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.</p><p>When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had \u201cdone it a purpose.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image027-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.</p><p>It was rather hurt.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image028-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image029-thumbnail.jpg'></img><p>So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.</p><p>But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.</p><h3> THE END</h3>"}
