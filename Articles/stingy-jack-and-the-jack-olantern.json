In school there was going to be a Halloween party with a parade.\u00a0 They were also going to carve out a pumpkin.</p><p>\u201cDo Jack O\u2019Lanterns grow with a funny face?\u201d asked Dylan Joseph.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d answered Dad. Jack O\u2019Lanterns start out as pumpkins. \u201cRemember went we went to the farm and we saw all those pumpkins on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do pumpkins become Jack O\u2019Lanterns?\u201d asked Dylan Joseph.</p><p>\u201cWe carve the faces into them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dylan Joseph asked</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Dad, \u201cthe tradition started many years ago in Ireland. There was a story that people told, much like a fairy tale, about an old man, named Stingy Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the story,\u201d Dylan Joseph begged.</p><p>Dad sat down on the couch and Dylan Joseph climbed up and sat near him.</p><p>\u201cMany years ago, there was an old man named Stingy Jack. Stingy Jack was always playing mean tricks on everyone. After Stingy Jack died, the story says that\u00a0 he was forced to wander around in darkness because of his evil ways. In order for him to find his way in dark, Jack put a piece of coal into a carved out turnip to provide some light in the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d asked Dylan Joseph.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Dad, \u201cthe Irish people named a day called Hallows Eve. On that day they would carve out pumpkins rather than turnips, because they were larger, and they put lights in them to scare off evil spirits and to frighten Stingy Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they\u2019re still evil spirits today?\u201d asked Dylan Joseph.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Dad. \u201cBut each year on that certain day in October, the children dress up in costumes and carve pumpkins into Jack O\u2019 Lanterns. Inside the Jack O\u2019Lantern they place a light just like they did many years ago in Ireland. They do this to frighten the make-believe evil spirits and Stingy Jack,\u201d said Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to carve the scariest face on my Jack O\u2019Lantern.,\u201d Dylan Joseph said. \u201cI want to make sure I frighten Stingy Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will,\u201d Dad said and gave Dylan Joseph a great big hug.</p>"}
