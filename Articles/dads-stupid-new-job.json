I have, and this is the story of it. Oh, BTW, my name is Martin Kelly, just so\u2019s you know, and I\u2019m nine years old.</p><p>Of course, being nine, what I think doesn\u2019t count for much when these things are decided. Mum and Dad held family meetings, sure, but they were to tell me what was happening, not to ask me what I wanted. Mum and Dad and Nuala (my big sister) had already decided what was happening. The family meetings were just to keep me quiet. Nuala is only five years older than me, but it seems fourteen is the age that you\u2019re allowed to help your parents with \u201cmajor life decisions\u201d (Dad\u2019s words, not mine).</p><p>So why are we moving, I hear you ask? (Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t: I\u2019m going to tell you anyway.) Well, it\u2019s Dad\u2019s job, that\u2019s why. Dad\u2019s stupid new job.</p><p>\u201cGreat news Martin!\u201d Mum told me, as casual as asking the time, one day when I arrived home from school. \u201cDad\u2019s got a big promotion.\u201d</p><p>Whoop-de-doo. I don\u2019t even really know what a promotion is. I think it means you start being the boss of the people that you work with, and I can\u2019t really see why that\u2019s such a big deal. I looked pleased because I thought I should, but Mum wasn\u2019t finished yet.</p><p>\u201cIt means we have to move to the city, Martin. Dad\u2019s new office is right in the city centre, beside the City Hall \u2013 remember where we went to see the Christmas lights being turned on?\u201d</p><p>I did remember, but suddenly that didn\u2019t seem important. Almost without noticing, Mum had just turned my life upside down.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I spluttered.</p><p>\u201cBeside the City Hall, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say we\u2019re moving house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, we have to. In fact, Dad and I have picked out our new house already. Martin? Martin?!\u201d Mum shouted after me as I felt my eyes sting and my bottom lip wobble and I bolted out of the kitchen like a scalded cat (as Gran used to say).</p><p>When he came home from work that night Dad found me \u2013 like he knew he would \u2013 standing under the holly tree in the back garden. I don\u2019t even know why I like that spot so much, but I do, it\u2019s my favourite, and Dad knew that. It\u2019s where I go when Mum and Dad, or Nuala, or someone in school, is unfair to me (usually Nuala).\u00a0 When I was very wee, my holly was a jungle, then it was a castle, then a pirates\u2019 ship, and now it\u2019s the flight deck of my atomic intergalactic space cruiser. That holly tree is my hidey hole, when I just want to get away from it all. From them all. And now I had to leave it behind. My holly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, son?\u201d Dad asked, after standing beside me in silence for a minute. He obviously hadn\u2019t spent the minute thinking what to say next.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, I\u2019m not,\u201d I replied, still fighting back tears. \u201cI\u2019m not all right at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the move, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s the move Dad! You didn\u2019t tell me anything, ask me anything. Then all of a sudden we\u2019re moving to Belfast. I have to leave my school, all my friends, everything. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Martin. You know what\u2019s happening in the world son, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlobal economic meltdown,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cI know, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiled to hear me use those words, but they\u2019d been everywhere recently \u2013 the telly, newspapers, teachers in school wanting to talk about it, teachers in school actually striking over it one day (I supported the strike, I decided, as I lay on the sofa all day in my pyjamas eating crisps and playing video games).</p><p>\u201cWell, son, lots of families\u2019 Dads and Mums are losing their jobs, but I\u2019ve managed to get a better one. That\u2019s a good thing, right? But it just so happens that this better job is in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do the job without us moving, Dad? Travel up and down every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work, Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad -\u201d I placed my hand on his arm in the way I saw him do with Mum when they were talking about something they didn\u2019t want me to hear (like moving house). I hoped it made me look grown up and serious. \u201cDad, don\u2019t do it. You don\u2019t need a better job. What\u2019s wrong with the old one? Can\u2019t everything just stay the same as it is now?\u201d</p><p>Dad smiled at me, but his eyes were kind of sad.</p><p>\u201cHas Mum told you about the new house yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust that you\u2019ve already picked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Martin. You\u2019ll love it. Your room is twice the size of the one you have here. We\u2019re going to fit out one room as a den \u2013 you can have your games consoles, music, all of your stuff in there \u2013 and there\u2019s a massive park just five minutes down the road where you can skateboard or bring your bike. And that\u2019s before you even think about all the museums and galleries and playgrounds and cinemas and big shops that you have in the city. You\u2019ll love it Martin. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He sounded like he was trying to persuade himself rather than me.</p><p>\u201cWhat about school?\u201d I asked, although if I was entirely honest school was rarely, if ever, a major consideration for me. \u201cI won\u2019t know anyone in the class, or the teacher, or the books. What if they use different books, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t, son. All the schools use the same books. You won\u2019t see any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t know anybody, Dad. And I\u2019ll never see Niall, or Declan, or Cathal EVER AGAIN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo will of course, Martin. We\u2019ll be back here all the time visiting your Nanny and Granddad. You\u2019ll see the gang loads. Nearly as much as you do now. Tell you what, when we get settled in at the new house we can bring Declan and Cathal and all the rest up for a sleepover. You could use the den. Play video games and eat pizza. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I want to stay here,\u201d I said and walked back into the house.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0#</p><p>\u00a0The next few weeks were a bit of a blur. Gradually, everything in our house disappeared, replaced by big tower blocks of boxes, marked with odd labels such as \u201cGood Room \u2013\u00a0 BREAKABLE!!!\u201d and \u201cKitchen \u2013 not needed immediately\u201d. I have to admit that playing with the miles of bubble wrap and the empty boxes was fun, and Mum and Dad definitely let me away with stuff that usually I\u2019d have got into big trouble for. Breaking \u201cNanny\u2019s Vase\u201d while I was playing Godzilla, for example: smashing the Belleek Vase that Nanny had bought Mum and Dad for a wedding present , would \u2013 usually \u2013 have been the kind of thing that got me grounded for a week minimum, with no Nintendo and no computer. And no pocket money, either. But when I told Mum, \u201cNanny\u2019s vase is broken\u201d (it\u2019s important when you tell parents stuff like this not to say \u201cI broke the vase\u201d \u2013 they usually work that out for themselves pretty quickly \u2013 just say \u201cit\u2019s broken\u201d or \u201cit broke\u201d), she just smiled tiredly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. Accidents happen. I shouldn\u2019t have left it out unwrapped like that.\u201d This made me very suspicious and I wondered if perhaps this news \u201chadn\u2019t sunk in yet\u201d, as I always hear people on TV saying.</p><p>So the weeks leading up to the move weren\u2019t as bad as I thought. School was weird \u2013 everyone kept saying to me, \u201cWhen do you go?\u201d and \u201cAre you not afraid?\u201d and even (I was thrilled to hear) \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, Kelly. I wish I lived in the city\u201d.</p><p>Declan, Cathal, Niall and I made sure we got the most out of those last few weeks. We went swimming at the lakes, played in the old quarry in the hills behind our house (which I was banned from doing, but I figured at that stage that all bets were off, as Dad would say, although I was never too sure what it meant) and spent hours and hours in each others\u2019 bedrooms, often just talking about nothing, and what life would be like for us all after the move.</p><p>Finally, the big day arrived. Mum asked me if I was excited, and in truth I was, but I couldn\u2019t tell her that. It was impossible not to be excited: the boxes, the big vans with the removal men who drank SOOOOOOOO much tea, the neighbours bidding tearful farewells, the promises to keep in touch \u2013 it was all so different and odd. It was sad, but it was exciting. I just couldn\u2019t admit it.</p><p>By 4 o\u2019clock, all the furniture and boxes had been loaded onto the vans. The only things left in the house was me, Nuala, Mum and Dad, and a single letter that had arrived for the people who were moving in (I thought it was very cheeky of them to have a letter for them sent to our house when we were still living there). As Mum and Dad fussed over the last few bits and pieces that were going in the car with us, I sneaked out the back door and headed for the bottom of the garden, to my holly. I just wanted to stand there one last time, and remember the days when I was an intrepid jungle explorer, a heartless pirate or an intergalactic space captain. I could feel my eyes starting to sting again and from the house I heard Dad shouting \u201cWhere\u2019s Martin? We\u2019re ready to go here.\u201d Mum replied, \u201cGive him a minute love. He\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d I walked backwards toward the house, to keep my holly in view the whole time. When I got back to the kitchen, Dad said, \u201cMartin, where \u2013 \u201c, but then he saw my red eyes and stopped.</p><p>It took over an hour to drive to the new house and Nuala annoyed me every second of every minute of that time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re always crying about moving, Martin.\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not always crying,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m just going to miss everyone and everything from the old house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything from the old house is already in the new house, Martin,\u201d Mum said. \u201cAll of your things will be in boxes in your new room and the den. As soon as we get there, I\u2019ll help you unpack. We\u2019ll get your Star Wars and Spiderman stuff up and it\u2019ll look just like your old room, you\u2019ll see. Only bigger.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0#</p><p>\u00a0\u201cMartin? Martin?!\u201d Mum shouted from the back door of the new house. \u201cWhere is that boy?\u201d</p><p>I heard her, and since it was the third time she\u2019d called me, I went.</p><p>\u201cHere, Mum\u201d I said as I entered the strange new kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d Mum replied, in the embarrassing voice she sometimes used for no reason. \u201cAnd who\u2019s this with you? Hello, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives next door, Mum. She\u2019s nine, and she\u2019s in my class at the new school. The teacher told them about me coming and when her Mum saw the vans, she sent her in here to meet me. She likes Star Wars, Mum, and Nintendo, and she\u2019s got a wicked bike, you should see it!\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the smile off my face.</p><p>\u201cAnd does this pretty young lady have a name, Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, embarrassed at realising I hadn\u2019t even asked her. \u201cSorry, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly\u201d she replied, and smiled the most brilliant smile I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0END.</p>"}
