Slowly he could feel himself rise up up in the air.</p><p>\u2018Oh no, help!\u2019 he called out.</p><p>The balloons all looked up as Blue was floating away.</p><p>\u2018Hey, if you make it back, let us know how you got on!\u2019 Orange yelled.</p><p>\u2018Yup \u2013 never going to see him again,\u2019 snorted Red.</p><p>\u2018Oh yeah, hope this is not like last year when we lost three comrades,\u2019 sighed Orange. \u2018That was not a good year.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey party is starting,\u2019 yelled Red as he pushed in front of all the balloons and let out a fart.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Blue was still in the sky floating up and up toward the clouds.</p><p>\u2018Oh, this is so scary. What is going to happen to me?\u2019 he sobbed.</p><p>Just then he heard voices, \u2018Hey, we have a newbie, come on, let\u2019s go rescue him.\u2019</p><p>Blue saw a yellow and white balloon coming towards him.</p><p>\u2018Are you ok?\u2019 asked the White balloon.</p><p>\u2018Yes I think so,\u2019 sobbed Blue. \u2018I was at a party and got detached from my crew.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not to worry,\u2019 assured White. \u2018It happens all the time.\u00a0 Stick with us and you\u2019ll be ok.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I need to get back to the party,\u2019 Blue gasped.</p><p>\u2018Ah, you\u2019ll be alright if you miss the party,\u2019 said White. \u2018C\u2019mon, follow us and we\u2019ll show you something amazing.\u2019</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Blue looked down at the city underneath and giggled \u2018Everything looks so tiny.\u00a0 Hey I see my friends at the party.\u00a0 Oh what are the children doing?\u2019 he gasped.</p><p>All the balloons at the party were bouncing and fleeing for help.\u00a0 The children were playing a game of who can poke the most balloons. Red was bouncing on top of everyone trying to escape as the children ran after him laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u2018Oh, that does not look like a good game,\u2019 he cried.</p><p>\u2018Nope, you are definitely not missing much there,\u2019 Yellow chuckled. \u2018C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But what do I do without my string?\u2019 Blue asked.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll keep you safe. Hey look at me,\u2019 White giggled as he started bouncing up and down and round and round.</p><p>\u2018Oh that looks like fun,\u2019 laughed Blue as he started to do the same.\u00a0 \u2018Yippee, I don\u2019t need my string\u2026weeeee!!!\u2019</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Blue continued to follow Yellow and White as they floated up and up in the air.</p><p>\u2018Hurry, we\u2019re almost there!\u2019 yelled White.</p><p>Blue saw in front of him something white and fluffy.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he gasped.</p><p>\u2018We call this a cloud,\u2019 said Yellow. \u2018Quick, let\u2019s go through it before it blows away.\u2019</p><p>Blue carefully followed White and Yellow through the cloud.</p><p>\u2018Ooh, this feels tickly and it looks like a yummy marshmallow,\u2019 Blue described as he stuck his tongue out to taste it. \u2018Ooh, but it tastes like hairy dinosaur feet and mouldy cheese!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oops should have warned you about that one,\u2019 apologised White.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Blue continued to float up and up into the sky and bobble and bobble along. He was amazed when he saw how bright everything around him was.</p><p>\u2018Hey, where\u2019s the cloud gone?\u2019 he called out.</p><p>\u2018Ah, this is the land over clouds called Missing Balloon Land. Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u2019 said White.\u00a0 \u2018Quick, follow us.\u2019</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Blue followed White and Yellow and he could hear voices and lots of laughter.\u00a0 As he got closer he could hear cheers.</p><p>\u2018Hey, we have another one!\u2019 he could hear White saying.</p><p>Blue looked and saw balloons of all different colours everywhere.</p><p>\u2018Hey everyone meet Blue, he\u2019s another lucky one we found,\u2019 explained White.</p><p>All the balloons bounced up and down and round and round.\u00a0 A purple balloon came over to Blue and said, \u2018Ah the white sticky tongue. I take it White forgot to warn you about sticking it out on the cloud?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Blue giggled. \u2018I won\u2019t be doing that for a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Anyhow, welcome to Missing Balloon Land.\u00a0 No balloon will ever blow away from here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So this is where you go when the wind takes you away. What do you do all day \u2013 should I go back and tell my friends?\u2019 asked Blue</p><p>\u2018Ah this is the exciting part,\u2019 replied Purple. \u2018Every day here is like a party. We get to stay blown up and no more going into drawers and waiting for a party to start.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you can learn new tricks like this,\u2019 interrupted White as he spun around and around as fast as anyone ever saw.</p><p>\u2018Wow, that is a great trick,\u2019 squealed Blue.</p><p>\u2018Hey, let\u2019s get this party started and show Blue how much fun Missing Balloon Land is,\u2019 cried Purple.</p><p>\u2018Oh that sounds fun,\u2019 Blue laughed as he bounced and rolled over to his new friends.</p><p>Everyone cheered and bounced and bobbled and Blue was the happiest balloon ever.</p>"}
