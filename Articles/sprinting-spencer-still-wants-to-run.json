But not me! \u00a0My thoughts laid elsewhere; I was thinking about Sprinting Spencer.</p><p>Who is Sprinting Spencer you ask? Well, Sprinting Spencer is a horse, and not just any horse; there was a time when Sprinting Spencer was considered the fastest horse that ever lived. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t just fast \u2013 he was really, really fast. \u00a0But then he got hurt. \u00a0And once that happened his racing days were over.</p><p>In his very last race, Sprinting Spencer was way ahead of all the other horses when he tripped and hurt his leg. Luckily, the doctors were able to fix Sprinting Spencer\u2019s leg so he could walk, but his leg just wasn\u2019t the same after his accident. The lightning fast speed he once had was all but gone.</p><p>After Sprinting Spencer\u2019s injury few people in town paid him much attention. It was sad to see him treated that way. He used to be everything to our little town. Everyone knew Sprinting Spencer\u2019s name and people would visit from far away just to catch a glimpse of him. Sadly, what people in town forgot to realize is that Sprinting Spencer was the one most devastated about not being able to race anymore. He really missed running.</p><p>I could see Sprinting Spencer whenever I wanted, because I lived in the farmhouse across the road from him. Sprinting Spencer needed a friend now more than ever, so I went over to see how he was doing.</p><p>When I approached Sprinting Spencer\u2019s stable he was visibly upset. Horses are known for whimpering, but I soon discovered they actually cry sometimes too. It was hard to see my friend that way. I did everything I could to try and cheer Sprinting Spencer up, but nothing seemed to work. He wouldn\u2019t even accept the apples I offered him. That was a first.</p><p>After about a minute went by, Sprinting Spencer finally looked up at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you would even want to be seen with me. I\u2019m just useless now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be friends and you should be proud of all the races you won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be proud when the whole town is ashamed of me,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer. \u201cI let everybody down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did no such thing,\u201d I said. \u201cYour success is the biggest thing that ever happened to our little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure didn\u2019t finish the way I wanted to, though,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer. Sprinting Spencer hung his head as tears rolled down his face. I didn\u2019t know what to say to him. I felt helpless.</p><p>The wind had picked up and the sky was very dark. \u201cYou better get home where it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer.</p><p>At that moment, the loudest, most thunderous boom you ever heard crackled directly over us. It was so loud it shook our entire town. After the thunder rumbled, the sound of animals crying out for help soon followed. Sprinting Spencer recognized the cries for help immediately, because they were his friends.</p><p>Just down the road from us set a very old farmhouse and barn. The barn was full of animals. In addition to horses, there were also cows, ducks and rabbits in the barn. We soon realized why the animals were crying out for help when smoke poured out of the barn\u2019s roof. The barn had been hit by lightning.</p><p>Earlier that day, I had waved to the owner of the barn, Mr. Harpole, and his family, as they drove to the Fourth of July festivities. With the Harpole family in town there was no way they would be able to save the animals from the fire.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get help,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer.</p><p>\u201cThe fire department is part of the parade and probably isn\u2019t available,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me out of here,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer.</p><p>I opened up the gate to Sprinting Spencer\u2019s stable and jumped on his back.</p><p>VROOM! Sprinting Spencer dashed out of the stable so fast I nearly fell off of him. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHang on tight,\u201d said Sprinting Spencer. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><p>Even though Sprinting Spencer\u2019s injury prevented him from ever racing against other horses again, he was still very fast. As we approached the burning barn, I carefully opened the main gate and stepped to the side. At that moment, a big gray cloud of smoke blew out of the barn.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d yelled several of the animals. \u201cPlease help us.\u201d</p><p>Sprinting Spencer told me to stay back as he darted into the barn. One by one, Sprinting Spencer freed all the animals from the burning barn. When he brought the animals out of the barn he asked one of the horses, \u201cWhere can I get some water to put out these flames?\u201d</p><p>The horse, who was still rubbing his eyes from the smoke said, \u201cThe water well is on the other side of the barn.\u201d</p><p>VROOM! Sprinting Spencer dashed to the other side of the barn so fast I thought he was using magic. He picked up the bucket next to the well and dipped his head into the water.</p><p>Sprinting Spencer raced to the barn and splashed the water over the flames. He did this over and over again. While Sprinting Spencer dashed back and forth between the well and the barn, the fire department finally arrived on the scene. Several folks came out from town as well. Before the firemen could pull the first hose off their truck, Sprinting Spencer had put out the very last flame.</p><p>As everyone praised Sprinting Spencer for saving the animals and barn, his chestnut brown coat turned bright red out of embarrassment.</p><p>Great things came Sprinting Spencer\u2019s way because of his heroics that day; he made the front page of the paper, and the whole town considered him a hero again. That made Sprinting Spencer feel good, but all he ever really wanted was to feel needed and loved in the first place\u2026 that and a good bowl of oats.</p>"}
