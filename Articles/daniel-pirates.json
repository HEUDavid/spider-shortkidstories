They trembled at the boom of the cannon, the cracking of the mast, the screams of alarm and shouted orders.</p><p>Their father\u2019s last words had been, \u201cStay here. Whatever happens I want you to trust God. He\u2019ll be with you. Remember that.\u201d\u00a0 Then he disappeared up the ladder to help in the battle.</p><p>The black pirate flag on the approaching ship had struck terror in the hearts of most of the passengers on board. Daniel wasn\u2019t too sure about trusting God but he did trust the captain and crew, who were strong and brave. When he heard the pounding of footsteps on the wooden stairs though, and the triumphant shouts of the pirates searching every cabin, he knew that the crew had not been successful. The boisterous men finally entered the hold, opening barrels and smashing crates.</p><p>\u201cGod will take of us,\u201d Anna Marie said in the faintest of whispers. Daniel wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>And finally the barrel that hid them was shoved away.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well\u2014what do we have here?\u201d</p><p>Rough hands yanked them out.</p><p>\u201cTwo little varmints down here, Captain,\u201d a tall pirate with shaggy hair shouted.</p><p>\u201cWell, bring \u2018em up.\u201d</p><p>On deck, smoke filled the air and fire blazed at the far end. The captain looked them over.</p><p>\u201cLet them live. I need a new cabin boy. And the girl can scrub floors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other captives, Captain,\u201d said a vicious-looking little man. \u201cAll the rest are drowned by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of booty, though,\u201d said another. \u201cPassengers had a goodly amount of gold, sir.\u201d</p><p>Most of the buccaneers were working fast, getting their loot off the ship. Soon Daniel and Anna Marie were being forced down the ladder into a small boat below. As it moved out, they could see that the bow of the London Lady was nearly submerged. The fire was spreading rapidly, flames bursting up and consuming everything in its path.</p><p>On the pirate ship, the two were left to themselves for a moment. Daniel put his arm around his sister and they stood at the rail watching the wreck as the smoke billowed forth, darkening the sky.</p><p>\u201cWe belong to the Kingsbury family of London\u2014and we\u2019ve come to this,\u201d he muttered\u00a0 bitterly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t be telling the likes of them,\u201d came a raspy voice beside them.</p><p>Daniel jumped. He whirled around and saw an old man with long, stringy hair and tattered clothes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u00a0 Get away from us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I\u2019m a captive just as you are. I\u2019m not one of them. Come with me. Maybe they\u2019ll let you stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would we want to?\u201d snapped Daniel.</p><p>Anna Marie scowled at him and turned to the man. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she said, taking the lead in following him as he guided them down a ladder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, boy, don\u2019t be saying who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut our uncle is a colonel and he\u2019ll have the navy here as soon as he hears of this disgrace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese buccaneers aren\u2019t fools. They\u2019ll be away from here and in hiding before your uncle even gets word of it.\u201d</p><p>A deafening blast rent the air, causing them all to leap back startled.</p><p>\u201cThere she goes. No one will ever know what happened here.\u201d</p><p>Anna Marie put a hand over her mouth as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>\u201cStop making her cry!\u201d snapped Daniel angrily.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his sister gulped. \u201cDan. I\u2019m all right. Look, we\u2019ve got someone to help us. God\u2019s taking care of us just as Papa said.\u201d</p><p>Daniel turned on her furiously. \u201cThe last thing I want to hear about is God!\u00a0 I\u2019m going to do something about this.\u201d</p><p>But the man grabbed his arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll just go worse for you making a row, boy. Just lay low for now. Your time will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours hasn\u2019t\u2014or so it appears,\u201d Daniel hissed angrily.</p><p>The man paused at the door to the galley. Finally, he said, \u201cno, I haven\u2019t had my chance yet even after eight years. They watch me closely. But maybe we can help each other.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly a voice came from the other end of the passageway. \u201cWhat\u2019re doin\u2019 with them captives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting them to work if you want your dinner on time,\u201d the man yelled back. \u201cDid you bring any food aboard? I suppose not. All you\u2019re interested in is booty and you expect me to cook meals out of nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we brought food, old man. Come up and get it ye\u2019self and then get to work!\u00a0 We\u2019re hungry!\u201d The pirate disappeared up the\u00a0 steps.</p><p>Daniel stared at him and finally said, \u201cthank you, sir,\u201d to show he was sorry for not believing the old man.</p><p>Their new friend smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>The two young people settled into their new life. Anna Marie helped with the cooking, something she knew nothing about since servants did all that at home. But she was quite willing to learn. They discovered that the elderly man who had befriended them was Mr. Robert Penningworth. He had been a professor in a large school back in England. He was also very religious.</p><p>Daniel did his chores for the captain stoically. He was careful to keep his hatred\u00a0 hidden, knowing that the time would be right someday and then he would extract revenge a hundredfold!</p><p>\u201cBitterness never pays, boy,\u201d Robert told him and his sister seemed to agree.</p><p>But Daniel didn\u2019t listen. He couldn\u2019t abide them talking about God either. Every evening the man read aloud from a small battered Bible that he kept safe in a burlap bag.</p><p>\u201cOnly thing they let me keep,\u201d the man had told them the first night, holding it as if it were priceless. \u201cNone of them wanted it.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t blame them. What good\u2019s it doing you?</p><p>Robert pursed his lips. He seemed to know what Daniel was thinking but he just cheerfully continued reading and discussing the Scriptures with Anna Marie.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>One night everything changed. Land had been sighted that day and a visitor came rowing toward the ship around sunset. The captain called on Daniel for food and drink as he welcomed the unsavory man into his cabin.</p><p>While he was serving the food, Daniel paid close attention\u2014and gained some very interesting information. The captain and the visitor had business some distance down the coast. The man had brought a huge chest of gold on board and apparently had more hidden in a cave at their destination. As Daniel passed, he couldn\u2019t help staring at the gleaming gold and jewels. Then he noticed the captain staring at him and he forced himself to tend to his work and return to his indifferent manner. But that night he and Robert and Anna Marie began making plans for escape.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>The evening they had been waiting for finally arrived. Since there was no moon, it was quite dark. The pirate ship entered a cove which was deep enough to anchor safely.</p><p>And close enough for them to swim to shore.</p><p>They had little of value to take with them except for Robert\u2019s precious Bible in a waterproof sack. Most of the men went ashore for an evening of drinking and gambling in the local village. The guard on duty was lazy. They knew he wouldn\u2019t bother watching once the captain was gone. He would probably fall asleep.</p><p>After the captain and his visitor left to go ashore, Daniel hurried to leave the cabin with his tray of dishes and meet Robert and Anna Marie. But he suddenly stopped short. The chest in the corner had been left unlatched! As he slowly put the tray down and went to the chest, lifting the lid, he realized for the first time that he didn\u2019t just despise the buccaneers, he was intensely jealous of their wealth. The sparkling treasure made him dizzy and he shook his head in awe\u2026and excitement.</p><p>He knew he needed to hurry. Now might be their only chance to get away for years perhaps. But he couldn\u2019t stop staring at the mass of glittering jewels and coins. He grabbed up a pouch and filled it. The captain\u2019s big knife with the fancy gold handle was laying nearby, too.</p><p>Suddenly a voice behind him made him jump. \u201cBoy, you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>It was Robert, with Anna Marie, coming to find out what was taking him so long. He glared at them.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be just like them, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like them!\u201d hissed Daniel. He held onto the pouch. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need money to get back to London. And\u2014this\u2014is for protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it isn\u2019t, Dan,\u201d said Anna Marie quietly.</p><p>Daniel knew she was right. He longed for these things more than anything\u2014except perhaps revenge.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d urged Robert. \u201cWe have to go\u2014now.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stared at the coins and the knife longingly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dan\u2026.Papa wouldn\u2019t want you to steal,\u201d Anna Marie pleaded.</p><p>Finally he left both the pouch and the knife on the desk and turned away. It was the hardest thing he had ever done and it was only for his sister and the memory of his father, not because he wanted to. But Anna Marie rewarded him with a big smile and Robert slapped him on the back. They quickly climbed the ladder to the deck and Robert poked his head out cautiously. The pirate on duty was already dozing. Tiptoeing behind some barrels, the old man silently let the rope ladder down.</p><p>They slipped over the rail, climbed down, and dropped into the water. Helping Anna Marie, whose long dress hindered her, they swam the short distance. The trio stumbled up on the beach, dripping and weary.</p><p>They were free!</p><p>One of the small boats was on the beach, near the opening to a cave, so they quickly ducked behind some rocks.</p><p>They\u2019d hidden just in time for they suddenly heard voices near the mouth of the cave. \u201cThere\u2019s the captain and the stranger. They\u2019ve got more treasure,\u201d whispered Robert.</p><p>The three watched as another wooden chest was loaded onto the small boat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going back out to the ship\u2014without the rest of the crew,\u201d observed Robert.</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d Anna Marie pointed out. \u201cThey might be coming back this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir boat isn\u2019t here. They probably docked at the village.\u201d Robert led the way around the cliff, staying in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be hiding,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cWe should be going for the magistrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a coastal village. Most of the time the authorities are powerless. Pirates are vicious and the townspeople probably just lay low until they\u2019re gone.\u201d Robert told him. \u201cLeave it to God, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Daniel hated advice like that. What could God do, anyway?</p><p>\u201cHe brought us this far,\u201d Robert reminded him. \u201cHe kept you both from being killed or harmed. I know it\u2019s been hard these last few weeks but He\u2019s protected you in ways you can\u2019t know. Pirates can be ruthless. They\u2019ll hurt just for fun.\u201d</p><p>They were heading into the forest when a deafening BOOM split the air. Cannon fire! They whirled and looked out to sea.</p><p>A ship! Flying the British flag!</p><p>The British navy ship had apparently sailed into the cove while they were creeping \u2018round the cliff. They watched as the pirate ship was bombarded with cannon balls.</p><p>\u201cGod knew they were coming all the time!\u201d shouted Robert, excitedly.</p><p>Daniel was stunned. God did have it under control, after all. Perhaps he should believe the things he\u2019d always been taught. Perhaps he should have faith in God. He\u2019d have to think about it\u2026.</p><p>Suddenly there was a commotion coming from the village. It looked like the rest of the pirates were running for the beach\u2014with a mob behind them.</p><p>Then Anna Marie shouted, \u201clook! It\u2019s Papa!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p>Reunited with their father once again, they discovered that he and several of the crew and passengers had not perished but had been picked up by the navy ship not long after the London Lady sank. The wounded had been brought here and the navy vessel had gone after the pirate ship. They had been there, out of sight, all the time. Just as they were ready to take the ship, they recognized the stranger as someone they had been searching for and decided to wait. And now they had captured them all and found the pirates\u2019 lair.</p><p>Daniel knew exactly what Robert was thinking as the old man grinned at him. He and Papa and Anna Marie had been right after all.</p><p>And actually, Daniel didn\u2019t mind being wrong\u2014this once.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The End</p>"}
