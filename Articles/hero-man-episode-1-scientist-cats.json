While he was wondering, he heard people screaming and shouting. It was fire!!! Ralph quickly ran into his house. While he was running to his home, he called his friend, Robin. Ralph said \u201cHey Robin, I could be late for your magic trick, I\u2019m sorry, bye.\u201d Robin said \u201cit\u2019s ok, bye.\u201d</p><p>When Ralph reached home, he took out his clothes and wore his armor, protective suit, wrist power\u00a0watch, a GPS device, and lenses with a small alarm to know if he had another mission to do. So, he\u00a0rushed to the Main Public Street (the place where the fire was.) There was so much fire that he couldn\u2019t believe.\u00a0So, he went inside, took out the trapped people and made sure that everyone was safe. He also combined ice & water then sprayed it over the damaged museum.</p><p>Then his alarm said \u201cThis fire was a bomb blast, it was the crime of three scientist cats, they are evil\u00a0and they have so many powers than you, Hero Man. They live at the 74 East Street. They live in a\u00a0building called Pleasant Apartments\u201d.</p><p>Hmm,\u201d thought Hero man, \u201cso where is that Pleasant Apartments?\u201d</p><p>He took out his GPS and set the route to 74 East Street, it was just 100.1 miles!!! So Hero Man used Reach Blast to get there quickly. When he saw a welcome board it said \u2018Welcome to\u00a0New York City,\u2019 then he asked someone for routes. Hero Man asked \u201cWhere is the Pleasant\u00a0Apartments?\u201d</p><p>A man nearby said \u201cIt\u2019s near the Subway Station.\u201d Hero man said \u201cThank you very\u00a0much\u201d. The man said \u201cYou\u2019re most welcome\u201d. Then he headed down the street and finally reached the Pleasant Apartments.</p><p>Then he asked a girl who was walking-by \u201cWhere are the scientist cats?\u201d Then she said \u201cThey live in the apartment 334.Why do you want to meet them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to meet them I\u2019m going to crush them\u201d. Then he explained how they made a\u00a0building blast in his city.</p><p>\u201cOh, ok\u201d said the girl.</p><p>Then Hero man ran upstairs and kicked opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to be arrested, scientist cats!\u201d he said.</p><p>Then, his mind filled with power, strength and fury that he blasted all their powers. Then the cats started to run away. He chased the cats down the street, but he couldn\u2019t catch up with them. So he used his Reach Blast and caught them. Then he took them to the jail and explained the officer how they blasted their building.</p><p>\u201cYou will pay for this, cats,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then Hero man went to his home using his Reach Blast and changed himself into Ralph and called his friend, Robin.</p><p>He said \u201cSorry Robin I could not come for your magic trick. I will come next time\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d said Robin, \u201cbye Ralph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Robin,\u201d said Ralph. Then Ralph went to rest. That was the glory of Hero Man.</p>"}
