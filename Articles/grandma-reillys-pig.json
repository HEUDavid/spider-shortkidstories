It was very heavy. She tore off the paper carefully. Inside was a big yellow china pig. Shona loved the pig\u2019s rounded sides with painted daisies. She loved the huge smile on the pig\u2019s china face. Most of all Shona loved its long, thick eyelashes and curly wurly tail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a piggy bank.\u201d said Gran. \u201cLook, it\u2019s got a slot on the top where you put in your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you get it out again?\u201d asked Shona.</p><p>Gran turned over the piggy bank. She showed Shona the oval shaped bung on the bottom.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Shona.</p><p>She carried her new pig carefully upstairs to her bedroom and put it on the windowsill. That night she showed it to Dad.</p><p>\u201cGrandma Reilly\u2019s Pig!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Grandma Reilly\u2019s,\u201d said Shona. \u201cIt\u2019s mine. Grandma gave it to me for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave you her pig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better take care of it.\u201d said Dad. \u201cIt\u2019s years old, that pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma gave me something second hand for my birthday!\u201d Shona pulled a face.</p><p>\u201cYes. And a very lucky girl you are too. That\u2019s a very special pig. You\u2019d better look after it, Shona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Shona promised. She drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The next morning Shona looked at the pig. Its smile made her feel happy. She kissed its nose and giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put birthday money into your piggy bank?\u201d suggested Dad over breakfast. Shona raced upstairs with her money. She put every coin and every note into the pig, one by one. The pig smiled and Shona kissed its nose again.</p><p>Two days later Shona saw a pretty dress she just had to have. That evening she prised the bung from the piggy bank, counted out the money she needed to buy the dress and put it in a drawer.</p><p>The following morning, Shona took the money out of her drawer. She went to kiss Grandma Reilly\u2019s Pig. But the pig looked different this morning, not quite so round and plump. Shona shrugged her shoulders and kissed it anyway.</p><p>Later that day, Shona ran upstairs in her new dress.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d she said to the piggy. \u201cDon\u2019t I look like a princess?\u201d</p><p>She admired herself in the bedroom mirror.</p><p>Hmm, she said to herself, I\u2019d look even more like a princess if I had a crown.</p><p>\u201cCan I buy a crown?\u201d she asked Dad.</p><p>\u201cWhy not make one with your craft kit? Dad suggested.</p><p>But Shona wanted a proper crown. She looked on the Internet and found it \u2013 the perfect princess crown. The crown was silver with glittering multicoloured jewels. It even came in a red velvet lined box. She showed Dad.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve just had your birthday.\u201d Dad shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shona,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI could use my birthday money. I\u2019ve got loads left.\u201d Shona pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWell I suppose so,\u201d agreed Dad. He ordered the crown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ten pounds you owe me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shona had hoped Dad would forget to ask her for the money. She dragged herself upstairs and counted ten pounds from the piggy bank. She didn\u2019t feel like kissing its nose today. She scowled as she put it back in the window.</p><p>Shona grew bored as she waited for the postman to bring her crown. She went into her bedroom and put on the dress.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get my crown I\u2019ll look even more like a princess,\u201d she whispered to Piggy.</p><p>\u201cPiggy!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cYou don\u2019t look well today. You look so thin. I\u2019m sure you were fatter when Grandma gave you to me.\u201d She picked up the piggy. She was sure it felt lighter too.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the post!\u201d called Dad. Shona hurtled down the stairs and raced down the drive. The startled postman gave her the package and she tore off the wrapper. The crown was even better that it had looked on the computer screen. Shona put it on and ran upstairs to admire herself in the mirror.</p><p>On Monday Shona\u2019s friend, Leah, came to tea. Leah had some new shoes. They were pink satin with embroidered flowers and they fastened with a pearly button. They were so cool.</p><p>After Leah\u2019s visit Shona pestered Dad to buy her some shoes like Leah\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll go with my new dress,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dad sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go halves\u201d said Shona, rushing to her piggy bank. She came down and offered Dad the money.</p><p>\u201cOh, go on then,\u201d said Dad. But Shona could tell he wasn\u2019t too pleased.</p><p>That night Shona went to kiss Piggy before she went to bed. His huge smile had gone. His mouth was a straight line which drooped at the edges. She gave him a cuddle and kissed him twice, but still he looked sad. Shona went to bed and dreamed of the pretty pink shoes.</p><p>The next morning she went to check on Piggy straight away. All the painted daisies had faded and what was worse, his curly wurly tail had uncurled. It looked like the tail of a mouse, not that of a piggy at all.</p><p>She rang Grandma Reilly. \u201cYour piggy\u2019s ill.\u201d she cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy piggy? I haven\u2019t got a piggy,\u201d said Grandma Reilly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone thin, and his flowers are disappearing and his tail \u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas his tail gone straight?\u201d asked Grandma.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d wailed Shona. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been feeding him right,\u201d said Grandma.</p><p>\u201cFeeding him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s a money bank. He needs money. Regular feeds.\u201d</p><p>Shona remembered the money she\u2019d taken out to spend;\u00a0 first for the crown, then\u00a0 for the shoes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take money out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure you can, sweetie. But don\u2019t just take out. You have to put in as well.\u201d</p><p>Shona ran to find Dad.</p><p>\u201cI want my money back,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Dad was puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThe money for the shoes. I want it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look here, Shona you agreed to go halves \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want the shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want the shoes?\u201d</p><p>Eventually Dad gave Shona the money. Shona took it and clumped upstairs, followed by Dad.</p><p>Dad watched as Shona pushed the money he\u2019d given her into the pig.</p><p>The pig\u2019s tail curled, his flowers came back and his mouth began to curve upwards again.</p><p>\u201cAh, Grandma Reilly\u2019s pig!\u201d said Dad.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d asked Shona.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Dad.\u00a0 He winked at the pig.</p><p>And the pig winked back, his lovely curly eyelashes squeezing together just for one second.</p>"}
