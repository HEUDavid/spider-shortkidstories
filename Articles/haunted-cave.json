Ralph hit the ball and ran for the first base. He was safe. It was summer and he was playing baseball with his friends, Michael, Jack, Steve and Robin. Ralph was expecting another mission but it hadn\u2019t come, so he wanted to explore the jungle called River Safari.</p><p>He wanted to see if there are any missions to do. His friends also wanted to go with him.</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Ralph\u2019s mother shouted.</p><p>Ralph stopped and shouted \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Ralph\u2019s mom called him and his friends to come inside. When Ralph and his friends entered, they saw that Ralph\u2019s mom was so cheerful.</p><p>She told them that they had won a million-dollar grand prize and that was when they bought a lottery ticket! They were going to River Safari and they had five tickets and it was one for each of them.</p><p>Ralph and his friends shouted \u201cYAY!\u201d</p><p>Mom said that they were going to leave at 12:00 A.M. and then Ralph and his friends started discussing what to do there.</p><p>\u201cWe will explore the River Safari!\u201d \u00a0suggested Mike.</p><p>\u201cWe could live there for five days!\u201d \u00a0said Steve.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just go to a special place?\u201d asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cWe can explore the haunted cave,\u201dsaid Robin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, Robin,\u201d said Ralph.</p><p>\u201cYESS!\u201d they all shouted \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><p>Chapter 2 \u2013 The Plan</p><p>It was midnight, 11:30 and Ralph was driving his friends to Austin Airport. Finally they reached the airport. The wind was so chilly and breezy that they ran with their suitcases. Ralph\u2019s luggage was heavy because he had his Hero Man suit and his other items. They took their tickets, went inside the airplane, and off they flew \u2026..</p><p>\u201cRoar!!!\u201d the airplane sounded. Ralph and his friends reached their stop, Hodgenville, Kentucky.</p><p>\u201cWhere is River Safari?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it is near 65 Market Street,\u201d Ralph guessed.</p><p>They went to the location that Ralph had guessed and sure enough, he was right.</p><p>They went to take their coupons and rented a cabin.</p><p>Then they discussed how to kill the deadly soldier in the haunted cave.</p><p>They started a brainstorming list of ideas and their idea was like this \u2013</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/hc-300x175.png'></img><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a perfect plan guys,\u201d Ralph said.</p>< Smack > they did a high five.<p>Steve said \u201cum, guys, I am feeling a little nervous, what if the soldier cooks us for his meal?\u201d Everybody laughed.</p><p>\u201cIf we all work together, we can do anything,\u201d Ralph said. The rest of them shouted, \u201cYes Ralph\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3 \u2013 Time for Battle</p><p>Ralph was disguised as Hero Man and he was with his friends, searching for the deadly soldier in the cave, suddenly something appeared near them.</p><p>It was the deadly soldier.</p><p>His appearance was shocking because he had a werewolf face, skeleton body, and a ghost\u2019s legs (actually he had no legs at all!)</p><p>Suddenly the soldier spit out something smoky and everyone covered their noses.</p><p>But Hero Man used his Ice Blast to clear out the smoke and then he tried to burn the soldier but the fire didn\u2019t work on him.</p><p>But Hero Man didn\u2019t give up, he used every power he had and they didn\u2019t work on him either.</p><p>Then Hero Man remembered how to kill the soldier.</p><p>It was \u2013 To kill the deadly soldier of River Safari you must mix the ice and fire to kill the deadly soldier and it must be 75 degrees hot and 50 degrees cold\u2026.</p><p>So Hero Man concentrated on how to do that while the rest were fighting with the deadly soldier\u2019s cronies and when they were finished, Hero Man shot a power mixed with ice and fire. The mixed ball of power reached to the deadly soldier\u2019s chest, but nothing happened to him! So Hero Man started flying toward the grossest pool [it had carbon di-oxide] and the deadly soldier followed him. Suddenly, Hero Man gave a jerk in his flying speed, causing the deadly soldier to fall in the pool and drown. Hero Man and friends waited for his another attack. Michael said, \u201cI guess that he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>The others agreed.</p><p>They smacked a high five.</p><p>When Hero Man was going, he found something shiny and grabbed it\u2026\u2026..</p><p>Chapter 4 \u2013 Returning Home</p><p>The next day Ralph and his friends were at the airport. They took their tickets and went to their airplane.</p><p>After sometime they reached their hometown, Austin, Texas and they went home on Ralph\u2019s car.</p><p>When they reached home, their Mom asked \u201cso how was trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice Mom,\u201d Ralph said.</p><p>\u201cBye Ralph,\u201d their friends said.</p><p>\u201cBye guys,\u201d Ralph said.</p><p>Then Ralph went to the bath and when he was finished he sat down to read a newspaper of his picture when he brought freedom at River Safari. He decided to hide it.</p>"}
