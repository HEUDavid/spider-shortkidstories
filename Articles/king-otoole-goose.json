Well, sir, you must know, as you didn\u2019t hear it before, that there was a King, called King O\u2019Toole, who was a fine old King in the old ancient times, long ago; and it was he that owned the churches in the early days. The King, you see was the right sort; he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and hunting in particular; and from the rising o\u2019 the sun, up he got, and away he went over the mountains after the deer; and fine times they were.</p><p>Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the King had his health; but, you see, in the course of time the King grew old, he became stiff in his limbs, and when he got older in years, his heart failed him, and he was at a loss for a distraction, because he couldn\u2019t go a-hunting no longer; and, by dad the poor King was obliged at last to get a goose to amuse him. Oh, you may laugh, if you like, but it\u2019s truth I\u2019m telling you; and the way the goose amused him was this-a-way: You see, the goose used to swim across the lake, and go diving for trout, and catch fish on a Friday for the King, and flew every other day round about the lake, entertaining the poor King. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got old in years like her master, and couldn\u2019t occupy him no longer, and then it was that the poor King was lost entirely. The King was walking one morning by the edge of the lake, lamenting his cruel fate, and thinking of drowning himself, that could get no enjoyment in life, when all of a sudden, turning round the corner, whom should he meet but a mighty decent young man coming up to him.</p><p>\u201cGod save you,\u201d says the King to the young man.</p><p>\u201cGod save you kindly, King O\u2019Toole,\u201d says the young man.</p><p>\u201cTrue for you,\u201d says the King. \u201cI am King O\u2019Toole,\u201d says he, \u201cprince and plennypennytinchery of these parts,\u201d says he; \u201cbut how came you to know that?\u201d says he.</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>You see it was Saint Kevin, sure enough\u2014the saint himself in disguise, and nobody else. \u201cOh, never mind,\u201d says he, \u201cI know more than that. May I make bold to ask how is your goose, King O\u2019Toole?\u201d says he.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, how came ye to know about my goose?\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cOh, no matter; I was given to understand it,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>After some more talk the King says, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an honest man,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cWell, honest man,\u201d says the King, \u201cand how is it you make your money so easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy making old things as good as new,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cIs it a gypsy you are?\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the saint; \u201cI\u2019m no gypsy by trade, King O\u2019Toole; I\u2019ve a better trade than a gypsy,\u201d says he\u2014\u201dwhat would you say,\u201d says he, \u201cIf I made your old goose as good as new?\u201d</p><p>My dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you\u2019d think the poor old King\u2019s eyes were ready to jump out of his head. With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, just like a dog, waddling up to the poor cripple, her master, and as like him as two peas. The minute the saint clapped his eyes on the goose, \u201cI\u2019ll do the job for you,\u201d says he, \u201cKing O\u2019Toole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Jaminee!\u201d says King O\u2019Toole, \u201cif you do, I\u2019ll say you\u2019re the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, by dad,\u201d says St. Kevin, \u201cyou must say more than that\u2014I\u2019m not so soft,\u201d says he, \u201cas to repair your old goose for nothing; what\u2019ll you give me if I do the job for you? That\u2019s the question,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever you ask,\u201d says the King; \u201cisn\u2019t that fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fairer,\u201d says the saint, \u201cthat\u2019s the way to do business. Now,\u201d says he, \u201cthis is the bargain I\u2019ll make with you, King O\u2019Toole: will you give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I make her as good as new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t go back on your word?\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cHonor bright!\u201d says King O\u2019Toole, holding out his fist.</p><p>\u201cHonor bright!\u201d says Saint Kevin, back again, \u201cit\u2019s a bargain. Come here!\u201d says he to the poor old goose\u2014\u201dcome here, you unfortunate ould cripple, and it\u2019s I that\u2019ll make you the sporting bird.\u201d With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings\u2014\u201dCriss o\u2019 my cross an you,\u201d says he, marking her to grace with the blessed sign at the same minute\u2014and throwing her up in the air, \u201cwhew,\u201d says he, just giving her a blast to help her; and with that, my jewel, she took to her heels, flying like one of the eagles themselves, and cutting as many shapes as a swallow before a shower of rain.</p><p>Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standing with his mouth open, looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark, and better than ever she was; and when she lit at his feet, patted her on the head, and \u201cMy Darling,\u201d says he, \u201cbut you are the darling of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you say to me,\u201d says Saint Kevin, \u201cfor making her the like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy japers,\u201d says the King, \u201cI say nothing beats the art of man, apart from the bees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you say no more nor that?\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cAnd that I owe you,\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cBut will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d says King O\u2019Toole, \u201cand you\u2019re welcome to it,\u201d says he, \u201cthough it\u2019s the last acre I have to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll keep your word true,\u201d says the saint.</p><p>\u201cAs true as the sun,\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s well for you, King O\u2019Toole, that you said that word,\u201d says he; \u201cfor if you didn\u2019t say that word, there was no chance your goose would ever fly again.\u201d</p><p>When the King was as good as his word, Saint Kevin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King. \u201cAnd,\u201d says he, \u201cKing O\u2019Toole, you\u2019re a decent man, for I only came here to test you. You don\u2019t know me,\u201d says he, \u201cbecause I\u2019m disguised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusha! then,\u201d says the King, \u201cwho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Saint Kevin,\u201d said the saint, blessing himself.</p><p>\u201cOh, queen of heaven!\u201d says the King, making the sign of the cross between his eyes, and falling down on his knees before the saint; \u201cis it the great Saint Kevin,\u201d says he, \u201cthat I\u2019ve been talking with all this time without knowing it,\u201d says he, \u201call as one as if he was a lump of a lad?\u2014and so you\u2019re a saint?\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d says Saint Kevin.</p><p>\u201cBy Japers, I thought I was only talking to a decent boy,\u201d says the King.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know the difference now,\u201d says the saint. \u201cI\u2019m Saint Kevin,\u201d says he, \u201cthe greatest of all the saints.\u201d</p><p>And so the King had his goose as good as new, to occupy him as long as he lived; and the saint supported him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death\u2014and that was soon after; for the poor goose thought he was catching a trout one Friday; but, my goodness, it was a mistake he made\u2014and instead of a trout, it was a thieving horse-eel; and instead of the goose killing a trout for the King\u2019s supper\u2014by dad, the eel killed the King\u2019s goose\u2014and small blame to him; but he didn\u2019t eat her, because he dared not eat what Saint Kevin had laid his blessed hands on.</p>"}
