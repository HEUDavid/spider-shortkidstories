\u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.\u201d</p><p>From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.</p><p>\u201cNo red rose in all my garden!\u201d he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.\u00a0 \u201cAh, on what little things does happiness depend!\u00a0 I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere at last is a true lover,\u201d said the Nightingale.\u00a0 \u201cNight after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.\u00a0 His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,\u201d murmured the young Student, \u201cand my love will be of the company.\u00a0 If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.\u00a0 If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.\u00a0 But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.\u00a0 She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere indeed is the true lover,\u201d said the Nightingale.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I sing of, he suffers\u2014what is joy to me, to him is pain.\u00a0 Surely Love is a wonderful thing.\u00a0 It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\u00a0 Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.\u00a0 It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe musicians will sit in their gallery,\u201d said the young Student, \u201cand play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.\u00a0 She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.\u00a0 But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her\u201d; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he weeping?\u201d asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.</p><p>\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.</p><p>\u201cHe is weeping for a red rose,\u201d said the Nightingale.</p><p>\u201cFor a red rose?\u201d they cried; \u201chow very ridiculous!\u201d and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.</p><p>But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student\u2019s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.</p><p>Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\u00a0 She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.</p><p>In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.</p><p>\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d</p><p>But the Tree shook its head.</p><p>\u201cMy roses are white,\u201d it answered; \u201cas white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.\u00a0 But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.</p><p>\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d</p><p>But the Tree shook its head.</p><p>\u201cMy roses are yellow,\u201d it answered; \u201cas yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.\u00a0 But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student\u2019s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student\u2019s window.</p><p>\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d</p><p>But the Tree shook its head.</p><p>\u201cMy roses are red,\u201d it answered, \u201cas red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.\u00a0 But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne red rose is all I want,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201conly one red rose!\u00a0 Is there no way by which I can get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is away,\u201d answered the Tree; \u201cbut it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to me,\u201d said the Nightingale, \u201cI am not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a red rose,\u201d said the Tree, \u201cyou must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart\u2019s-blood.\u00a0 You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.\u00a0 All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath is a great price to pay for a red rose,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201cand Life is very dear to all.\u00a0 It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.\u00a0 Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.\u00a0 Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?\u201d</p><p>So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\u00a0 She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.</p><p>The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cBe happy,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201cbe happy; you shall have your red rose.\u00a0 I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart\u2019s-blood.\u00a0 All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.\u00a0 Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.\u00a0 His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.\u201d</p><p>The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.</p><p>But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.</p><p>\u201cSing me one last song,\u201d he whispered; \u201cI shall feel very lonely when you are gone.\u201d</p><p>So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.</p><p>When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cShe has form,\u201d he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove\u2014\u201cthat cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?\u00a0 I am afraid not.\u00a0 In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.\u00a0 She would not sacrifice herself for others.\u00a0 She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.\u00a0 Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.\u00a0 What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.\u201d\u00a0 And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.</p><p>And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.\u00a0 All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.\u00a0 All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.</p><p>She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\u00a0 And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.\u00a0 Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river\u2014pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.\u00a0 As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.</p><p>But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\u00a0 \u201cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cor the Day will come before the rose is finished.\u201d</p><p>So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.</p><p>And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\u00a0 But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose\u2019s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale\u2019s heart\u2019s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.</p><p>And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\u00a0 \u201cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cor the Day will come before the rose is finished.\u201d</p><p>So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.\u00a0 Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.</p><p>And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\u00a0 Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.</p><p>But the Nightingale\u2019s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.\u00a0 Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.</p><p>Then she gave one last burst of music.\u00a0 The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.\u00a0 The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.\u00a0 Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.\u00a0 It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.</p><p>\u201cLook, look!\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cthe rose is finished now\u201d; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.</p><p>And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what a wonderful piece of luck!\u201d he cried; \u201chere is a red rose!\u00a0 I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.\u00a0 It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name\u201d; and he leaned down and plucked it.</p><p>Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor\u2019s house with the rose in his hand.</p><p>The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,\u201d cried the Student.\u00a0 \u201cHere is the reddest rose in all the world.\u00a0 You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.\u201d</p><p>But the girl frowned.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid it will not go with my dress,\u201d she answered; \u201cand, besides, the Chamberlain\u2019s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\u201d said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.</p><p>\u201cUngrateful!\u201d said the girl.\u00a0 \u201cI tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?\u00a0 Only a Student.\u00a0 Why, I don\u2019t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain\u2019s nephew has\u201d; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat I a silly thing Love is,\u201d said the Student as he walked away.\u00a0 \u201cIt is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.\u00a0 In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\u201d</p><p>So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.</p>"}
