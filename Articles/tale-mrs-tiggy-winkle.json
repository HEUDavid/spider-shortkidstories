She was a good little girl\u2014only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!</p><p>One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying\u2014oh, she did cry so! \u201cI\u2019ve lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/11-tb.jpg'></img><p>The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen\u2014</p><p>\u201cSally Henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?\u201d</p><p>But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking\u2014</p><p>\u201cI go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/12-tb.jpg'></img><p>And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.</p><p>Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.</p><p>Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town\u2014a hill that goes up\u2014up\u2014into the clouds as though it had no top!</p><p>And a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/15-tb.jpg'></img><p>Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way\u2014up and up\u2014until Little-town was right away down below\u2014she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/16-tb.jpg'></img><p>Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.</p><p>Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water\u2014but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet\u2014there were foot-marks of a very small person.</p><p>Lucie ran on, and on.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/19-tb.jpg'></img><p>The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes\u2014props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins\u2014but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</p><p>\u201cLily-white and clean, oh!</p><p>With little frills between, oh!</p><p>Smooth and hot\u2014red rusty spot</p><p>Never here be seen, oh!\u201d</p>"}
