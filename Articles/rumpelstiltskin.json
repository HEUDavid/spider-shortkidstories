The King was very fond of gold, and thought to himself, \u201cThat is an art which would make me very happy\u201d; and so he said to the Miller, \u201cIf your daughter is so very clever, bring her to the castle in the morning, and I will check if she really is as useful as you say.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she arrived the King led her into a chamber which was full of straw; and, giving her a wheel and a reel, he said, \u201cNow set yourself to work, and if you have not spun this straw into gold by an early hour to-morrow, you must die.\u201d With these words he shut the room door, and left the young girl alone.</p><p>There she sat for a long time, thinking how to save her life; for she didn\u2019t know how straw might be spun into gold; and her worry increased more and more, till at last she began to cry. All at once the door opened, and in stepped a little Man, who said, \u201cGood evening, fair maiden; why do you weep so much?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she replied, \u201cI must spin this straw into gold, and I am sure I do not know how.\u201d</p><p>The little Man asked, \u201cWhat will you give me if I spin it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy necklace,\u201d said the maiden.</p><p>The Dwarf took it, placed himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the bobbin was full. Then he set up another, and whir, whir, whir, three times round again, and a second bobbin was full; and so he went all night long, until all the straw was spun, and the bobbins were full of gold.</p><p>At sunrise the King came, very much astonished to see the gold; the sight of which gladdened him, but did not make his heart less greedy. He caused the maiden to be led into another room, still larger, full of straw; and then he told her to spin it into gold during the night if she valued her life. The maiden was again quite at a loss what to do; but while she cried the door opened suddenly, as before, and the Dwarf appeared and asked her what she would give him in return for his assistance. \u201cThe ring off my finger,\u201d she replied. The little Man took the ring and began to spin at once, and by morning all the straw was changed to glistening gold. The King was rejoiced above measure at the sight of this, but still he was not satisfied, but, leading the maiden into another still larger room, full of straw as the others, he said, \u201cThis you must spin during the night; but if you accomplish it you shall be my bride.\u201d \u201cFor,\u201d thought he to himself, \u201ca richer wife you cannot have in all the world.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/175.png'></img><p>When the maiden was left alone, the Dwarf again appeared and asked, for the third time, \u201cWhat will you give me to do this for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing left that I can give you,\u201d replied the maiden.</p><p>\u201cThen promise me your first-born child if you become Queen,\u201d said he.</p><p>The Miller\u2019s daughter thought, \u201cWho can tell if that will ever happen?\u201d and, not knowing how else to help herself out of her trouble, she promised the Dwarf what he desired; and he immediately set about and finished the spinning. When morning came, and the King found all he had wished for done, he celebrated his wedding, and the Miller\u2019s fair daughter became Queen.</p><p>The happy times she had at the King\u2019s Court caused her to forget that she had made a very foolish promise. Even the king turned out to be not quite the mean person he had appeared to be at first and they both fell in love with each other.</p><p>About a year after the marriage, when she had ceased to think about the little Dwarf, she brought a fine child into the world; and, suddenly, soon after its birth, the very man appeared and demanded what she had promised. The frightened Queen offered him all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her her child; but the Dwarf answered, \u201cNo; something human is dearer to me than all the wealth of the world.\u201d</p><p>The Queen began to weep and groan so much that the Dwarf pitied her, and said, \u201cI will leave you three days to consider; if you in that time discover my name you shall keep your child.\u201d</p><p>All night long the Queen racked her brains for all the names she could think of, and sent a messenger through the country to collect far and wide any new names. The following morning came the Dwarf, and she began with \u201cCaspar,\u201d \u201cMelchior,\u201d \u201cBalthassar,\u201d and all the odd names she knew; but at each the little Man exclaimed, \u201cThat is not my name.\u201d The second day the Queen inquired of all her people for uncommon and curious names, and called the Dwarf \u201cRibs-of-Beef,\u201d \u201cSheep-shank,\u201d \u201cWhalebone,\u201d but at each he said, \u201cThis is not my name.\u201d The third day the messenger came back and said, \u201cI have not found a single name; but as I came to a high mountain near the edge of a forest, where foxes and hares say good night to each other, I saw there a little house, and before the door a fire was burning, and round this fire a very curious little Man was dancing on one leg, and shouting:</p><p><i>\u201c\u2018To-day I stew, and then I\u2019ll bake,</i></p><p><em>To-morrow I shall the Queen\u2019s child take;</em></p><p><em>Ah! how famous it is that nobody knows</em></p><p><em>That my name is Rumpelstiltskin.'\u201d</em></p><p>When the Queen heard this she was very glad, for now she knew the name; and soon after came the Dwarf, and asked, \u201cNow, my lady Queen, what is my name?\u201d</p><p>First she said, \u201cAre you called Conrade?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you called Hal?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you called Rumpelstiltskin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch has told you! a witch has told you!\u201d shrieked the little Man, and stamped his right foot so hard in the ground with rage that he could not pull it out again. Then he took hold of his left leg with both his hands, and pulled away so hard that his right came off in the struggle, and he hopped away howling terribly. And from that day to this the Queen has heard no more of her troublesome visitor.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/177.png'></img>"}
