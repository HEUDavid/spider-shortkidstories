He was a spoiled boy, and loved play better than work; so that when Mustapha, his father, died, he was not able to earn his living; and his poor mother had to spin cotton all day long to buy food for their support. But she dearly loved her son, knowing that he had a good heart, and she believed that as he grew older he would do better, and become at last a worthy and prosperous man.</p><p>One day, when Aladdin was walking outside the town, an old man came up to him, and looking very hard in his face, said he was his father\u2019s brother, and had long been away in a distant country, but that now he wished to help his nephew to get on. He then put a ring on the boy\u2019s finger, telling him that no harm could happen to him so long as he wore it. Now, this strange man was no uncle of Aladdin, nor was he related at all to him; but he was a wicked magician, who wanted to make use of the lad\u2019s services, as we shall see in a moment.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus029s.jpg'></img><p>\u00a0</p><p>The old man led Aladdin a good way into the country, until they came to a very lonely spot between two high\u00a0black mountains. Here he lighted a fire, and threw into it some gum, all the time repeating many strange words. The ground then opened just before them, and a stone trap-door appeared. After lifting this up, the Magician told Aladdin to go below, down some broken steps, and at the foot of these he would find three halls, in the last of which was a door leading to a garden full of beautiful trees; this he was to cross, and after climbing\u00a0some more steps, he would come to a terrace, when he would see a small shelf, in which there was a lighted Lamp. He was then to take the Lamp, put out the light, empty the oil, and bring it away with him.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus031s.jpg'></img><p>\u00a0</p><p>Aladdin found all the Magician had told him to be true; he passed quickly but cautiously through the three halls, so as not even to touch the walls with his clothes, as the Magician had directed. He took the Lamp from the shelf, threw out the oil, and wrapped it in his arms. As he came back through the garden, his eyes were dazzled with the bright-coloured fruits on the trees, shining like glass. Many of these he plucked and put in his pockets, and then returned with the Lamp, and called upon his uncle to help him up the broken steps.</p><p>\u201cGive me the Lamp,\u201d said the old man, angrily.</p><p>\u201cNot till I get out safe,\u201d cried the boy.</p><p>The Magician, in an anger, then slammed down the trap-door, and Aladdin was shut up fast enough. While crying bitterly, he by chance rubbed the ring, and a figure appeared before him, saying, \u201cI am at your command, the Genius of the Ring; what do you desire?\u201d</p><p>Aladdin told the Genius of the Ring that he only wanted to be set free, and to be taken back to his mother. In an instant he found himself at home, very hungry, and his poor mother was much pleased to see him again. He told her all that had happened; she then felt curious to look at the Lamp he had brought, and began rubbing it, to make it shine brighter. Both were quite amazed at seeing rise before them a strange figure; this proved to be the Genius of the Lamp, who asked for their commands. On hearing that food was what they most wanted, a servant\u00a0instantly entered with the most delicious food upon a dainty dish of silver, and with silver plates for them to eat from.</p><p>Aladdin and his mother feasted upon the rich fare brought to them, and sold the silver dish and plates, on the earnings\u00a0of which they lived happily for some weeks.</p><p>Aladdin was now able to dress well, and in taking his usual walk, he one day chanced to see the Sultan\u2019s daughter coming with her attendants from the baths. He was so much struck with her beauty, that he fell in love with her at once, and told his mother that she must go to the Sultan, and ask him to give the Princess to be his wife.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus033s.jpg'></img><p>The poor woman said he must be crazy; but her son not only knew what a treasure he had got in the Magic Lamp, but he had also found how valuable were the shining fruits he had gathered, which he thought at the time to be only coloured glass. At first he sent a bowlful of these jewels\u2014for so they were\u2014to the Sultan, who was amazed at their richness, and said to Aladdin\u2019s mother: \u201cYour son shall have his wish, if he can send me, in a week, forty bowls like this, carried by twenty white and twenty black attendants, handsomely dressed.\u201d He thought by this to keep what he had got, and to hear no more of Aladdin.</p><p>But the Genius of the Lamp soon brought the bowls of jewels and the attendants, and Aladdin\u2019s mother went with them to the Sultan.</p><p>The Sultan was overjoyed at receiving these rich gifts, and at once agreed that the Princess Bulbul should be the wife of Aladdin. The happy youth then summoned the Genius of the Lamp to assist him; and shortly set out for the Palace. He was dressed in a handsome suit of clothes, and rode a beautiful horse; by his side marched a number of attendants, scattering handfuls of gold among the people.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus035s.jpg'></img><p>\u00a0</p><p>As soon as they were married, Aladdin ordered the Genius of the Lamp to build, in the course of a night, a most superb Palace, and there the young couple lived quite happily for some time.</p><p>One day, when Aladdin was out hunting with the Sultan, the wicked Magician, who had heard of his good luck, and wished to get hold of the Magic Lamp, cried out in the streets, \u201cNew lamps for old ones!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus037s.jpg'></img><p>A silly maid in the Palace, hearing this, got permission from\u00a0the Princess to change Aladdin\u2019s old Lamp, which she had seen on a stand\u00a0where he always left it, for a new one, and so the Magician got hold\u00a0of it.</p><p>As soon as the Magician had safely got the Lamp, he caused the Genius to remove the Palace, and Bulbul within it, to Africa.</p><p>Aladdin\u2019s grief was very great, and so was the rage of the Sultan at the loss of the Princess, and poor Aladdin\u2019s life was in some danger, for the Sultan threatened to kill him if he did not find\u00a0his daughter in three days.</p><p>Aladdin first called upon the Genius of the Ring to help him, but all he could do was to take him to Africa. The Princess was rejoiced to see him again, but was very sorry to find that she had been the cause of all their trouble by parting with the wonderful Lamp. Aladdin, however, consoled her, and told her that he had thought of a plan for getting it back. He then left her, but soon returned with a powerful sleeping-draught, and advised her to receive the Magician with pretended kindness, and pour it into his wine at dinner that day, so as to make him fall sound asleep, when they could take the Lamp from him.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus039s.jpg'></img><p>Everything happened as they expected; the Magician drank the wine, and when Aladdin came in, he found that he had fallen back asleep\u00a0on the couch. Aladdin took the Lamp from his arms, and called upon the Genius to transport the Palace, the Princess, and himself, back to their home\u00a0city.</p><p>The Sultan was as much astonished and pleased at their return, as he had been upset beyond measure\u00a0at the loss of his daughter.</p><p>As for \u00a0Aladdin with his lovely wife Bulbul, they lived long and happy lives afterwards enjoying their\u00a0good fortune.</p>"}
