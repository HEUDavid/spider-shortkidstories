and Honey Roadrunner.</p><p>They were a happy- go- lucky couple that were always seen running through their desert homeland and going up and down the arroyos in their neighborhood.</p><p>Like all roadrunners, Dasher and Honey were so fast that they were able to criss-cross the busy highway that ran straight through their desert without ever worrying that any of the cars that they always saw going faster then the speed limit would hit them.</p><p>Their blazing speed also helped them to avoid being eaten by Sinster Coyote who was always looking for an easy meal.</p><p>In time Dasher and Honey received a little bundle of joy from heaven which they named Carlito.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook how cute he is\u201d said Honey, \u201che has your brown eyes and long legs Dasher, I bet he will grow up to be just like you.\u201d</p><p>But as Carlito grew up they noticed something very strange about him.</p><p>When Carlito was 1 year old, Dasher and Honey noticed that he was not able to run as fast as all the other little roadrunners and that he was always stumbling and falling down.</p><p>Because of this, all the other little roadrunners were always making fun of him and none of them wanted to be his friend.</p><p>Carlito was very sad because he had no one to play with and everyday he just sat around the cactus patch wishing for a friend.</p><p>One morning as he stood around day-dreaming he heard a voice say \u201cHi there, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Carlito turned around to where the voice had come from and there he saw a little bunny rabbit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh nothing really important.\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Skipper,\u201d said the little bunny rabbit, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Carlito,\u201d he responded.</p><p>\u201cI have been watching you for a while and I noticed that none of the other little roadrunners will play with you, do you want to play with me?\u201d asked Skipper.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, that would be fun\u201d said Carlito, and all that day they played together until the sun started coming down in the Western sky and they both had to go home.</p><p>They next day Carlito was up at the crack of dawn and went straight to the cactus patch hoping that Skipper would be there to play with him again.</p><p>Carlito did not have to wait very long, \u201cBoo!\u201d said Skipper, jumping out from behind a large cactus plant, \u201cdid I scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t scare me, I knew you would be somewhere around here\u201d answered Carlito.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d said Skipper, \u201clet\u2019s play tag.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow do you play tag?\u201d asked Carlito.</p><p>\u201cIt is a very easy game to play; the first thing you have to do is run after me and try to touch me.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are able to catch me, you have to yell \u2018tag. your it\u2019 and then it will be my turn to try and tag you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee that sounds like fun\u201d said Carlito.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d yelled Skipper, \u201csee if you can catch me!\u201d and away ran Skipper with Carlito in hot pursuit.</p><p>Skipper was very illusive, as he ran, he dodged first one way and then another, he skipped, jumped and hopped around in a way that Carlito had never seen, and before long Carlito stumbled and fell flat on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d asked Skipper.</p><p>\u201cI always fall down when I run\u201d said Carlito, \u201cthat is why none of the other roadrunners will play with me.\u00a0\u00a0 I will understand if you don\u2019t want to play with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, I will still play with you\u201d said Skipper.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is very strange though, that you have trouble running, I always thought that roadrunners were born runners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and run,\u201d said Skipper to Carlito, \u201cI want to see how you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d said Carlito and he started running as fast as he could, but in a matter of seconds his legs got all tangled up and down he fell, creating a cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201cWow, you do have a problem,\u201d said Skipper, \u201cmaybe you should learn another way of running.\u00a0\u00a0 My dad taught me and my brothers how to run, and we run pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said and off he went in a combination of running, skipping, hopping, weaving and jumping.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that I can do all that,\u201d said Carlito, \u201cit looks very complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never know unless you try it, go ahead and give it a shot,\u201d said Skipper.</p><p>So Carlito sucked in all the air that he could and started running as fast as he could, first skipping and hopping and ended up on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take it slowly at first so that you can learn all the steps,\u201d said Skipper, \u201cnow go ahead and try again.\u201d</p><p>So Carlito dusted himself off, and slowly started running, skipping, hopping, weaving and jumping, over and over again, until he was able to do it without thinking of the steps.</p><p>As the days turned in weeks and the weeks into months, Carlito practiced his new running skills with Skipper, until he knew that he was able to run faster then all the other roadrunners.</p><p>One cloudy day as Carlito and Skipper played in the cactus patch, they heard what appeared to be a scream coming from the arroyo.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over there and see what is happening,\u201d said Carlito, and they both ran over in the direction of the sound.</p><p>When they got to the arroyo, they came upon a group of roadrunners standing around nervously.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat happened?\u201d they asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were all playing in the arroyo and all of a sudden Sinster Coyote came out of nowhere and snatched up Crissy Roadrunner and ran off with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you try and help her?\u201d asked Carlito.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat could we have done?\u201d they all responded in unison, \u201cWe are no match for Sinster Coyote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I am not afraid\u201d said Carlito, \u201cI am going after them to see what I can do,\u201d and off he ran with Skipper trailing behind him.</p><p>In a matter of minutes Carlito was able to see Sinster Coyote running up ahead with Crissy Roadrunner in his mouth and in no time overtook them.</p><p>\u201cHey there Sinster, you silly old coyote, what do you think you are doing running around with a roadrunner in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm goooymn tuu ettt hrrr,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you said, I couldn\u2019t understand a word?\u201d said Carlito.</p><p>\u201cUmm goooymn tuu ettt hrrr!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on you cranky old coyote, open your mouth and speak properly so that I can understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that I am going to eat her!\u201d said Sinster Coyote, but as he opened his mouth to speak, out fell Crissy Roadrunner.</p><p>\u201cRun Crissy,\u201d yelled Carlito, and off she went as fast as her legs could take her.</p><p>\u201cLook what you made me do!\u201d snarled Sinster Coyote to Carlito, \u201cWell she may have gotten away, but I am going to eat you instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d said Carlito.</p><p>Sinster Coyote\u2019s blazing red eyes narrowed ever so slightly as he looked at Carlito.\u00a0\u00a0 His great big teeth forming a menacing snarl as he said,\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may think that you are going to get away from me, but you are here in my home area, and I am really going to enjoy eating you.\u201d</p><p>With that Sinster Coyote leaped directly at Carlito, but to his surprise Carlito was no longer standing where he had been a second before.</p><p>\u201cHuh, what happened?\u201d he thought, and he looked around and saw Carlito off to the side.</p><p>\u201cCome on you dingy old coyote, what\u2019s the matter, are you getting old?\u201d</p><p>Again Sinster Coyote started running in Carlito\u2019s direction, but Carlito just started skipping, hopping, weaving, jumping and running and was able to stay many steps ahead of Sinster Coyote.</p><p>This went on for many minutes, but eventually Sinster Coyote gave up, completely out of wind and with his tongue hanging out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome on Skipper I don\u2019t think this old coyote will be bothering any of us for a long time.\u201d</p><p>They both ran back to the group of roadrunners to see how Crissy was feeling now that her ordeal had passed.</p><p>All the young roadrunners were standing in a circle around Crissy who was telling them about how Carlito had been so brave standing up to Sinster Coyote and how he had saved her.</p><p>As Carlito came up to them, they turned around to look at him and Carlito could see a look of admiration in their eyes and he felt very good.</p><p>\u201cHow is it that you were able to get the better of Sinster Coyote?\u201d they asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was with the help of my good friend Skipper.\u00a0\u00a0 You see, he taught me a better way to run and now no coyote can catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that you can show us too?\u201d all the roadrunners asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, both Skipper and I will show you and then none of you will have to be afraid of Sinster Coyote and his friends.\u201d</p><p>During the following weeks Carlito and Skipper had daily running lessons for all the roadrunners, including Crissy, who had become very close to Carlito.</p><p>Soon all the roadrunners had mastered the new way of running and no longer were afraid of coyotes.</p><p>Carlito became their leader and in time, Carlito and Crissy became a happily married couple and one day they had their own bundle of joy which they called Alfy, but that is another story.</p><p>One of these days if you happen to be traveling down the highway in the desert of Cactus Hill, Arizona and you run across some roadrunners who will be skipping, running, hopping, weaving and jumping, remember Carlito and Skipper who showed us that good friends are worth their weight in Gold.</p>"}
