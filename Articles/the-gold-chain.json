Suddenly they\u00a0noticed Hiru dada riding his blue bicycle looking here and there.</p><p>Tinu whispered \u2013 \u201cI think, he had lost something. Something valuable I guess.\u201d</p><p>Montu nodded and replied in a low voice \u2013 \u201cYeah and how fast he was riding?\u201d</p><p>Tinu rolled his eyes and said-\u201c I think he might be getting late to\u00a0open his bakery shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Those delicious cakes and pastries,\u201d they spoke together and\u00a0licked their lips as they ran through the inviting images of cakes and\u00a0pastries in their mind.</p><p>Just then Tinu spotted something shining in the dust.</p><p>\u201cWow! what a dazzling gold chain this is!\u201d he cried with joy.</p><p>\u201cAwesome, we have found his lost chain!\u201d Montu giggled.</p><p>Tinu whispered-\u201cThis chain looks quite expensive so we should\u00a0immediately go and give it to Hiru Dada.\u201d</p><p>And without wasting a minute, they almost ran to Hiru Dada\u2019s shop.</p><p>When they entered the shop, Hiru Dada was dealing with the customers.</p><p>Tinu said in a low voice-\u201cThe smell of chocolate pastries is driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Montu\u2019s mouth also got watered looking at his all time favourite\u00a0strawberry cakes.</p><p>After a moment Hiru Dada looked at them and asked surprisingly-\u201cWhat\u00a0are you doing here? Aren\u2019t you getting late for your school?\u201d</p><p>Hearing this, they both came out from their delicious imaginary world.\u00a0Their dream world of mouth watering cakes and pastries came unbroken.</p><p>Tinu took out the gold chain from his pocket and said-\u201cYour gold chain\u2026\u201d</p><p>Seeing such an expensive chain, Hiru Dada was surprised. He\u00a0replied-\u201cBut I have not lost anything.\u201d</p><p>Montu came ahead and replied-\u201cWe had observed you in a panicked mood\u00a0some time back. It seemed you were looking here and there continuously\u00a0searching for something precious.\u201d</p><p>Hiru Dada laughed and replied smilingly-\u201cHahaha! I had pain in my\u00a0neck, so I was rotating my neck to get rid of that pain.\u201d</p><p>Then Hiru dada looked at the chain and said-\u201cI will give it to\u00a0inspector Cheeetah, he will give it to its real owner.\u201d</p><p>Tinu and Montu smiled after hearing this and said-\u201cNow we must leave\u00a0for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you want to taste your favourite delicious cakes in your\u00a0lunch?\u201d Hiru Dada asked lovingly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have money.\u201d Montu replied in a sad voice.</p><p>\u201cI am very happy at your honesty and sincerity my little kids. So\u00a0treat this as a small gift from my side,\u201d Hiru dada said while giving\u00a0a box of their all time favourite strawberry and chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurraaahhhh! THANK YOU!\u201d they both cried with joy and left for the school happily.</p>"}
