Now you must know that this old wife had a little son, who was so plump and fat, and so fond of good things, that they called him Buttercup; she had a dog, too, whose name was Goldtooth, and as she was baking, all at once Goldtooth began to bark.</p><p>\u201cRun out, Buttercup, there\u2019s a dear!\u201d said the old wife, \u201cand see what Goldtooth is barking at.\u201d</p><p>So the boy ran out, and came back crying out,\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, Heaven help us! here comes a great big witch, with her head under her arm, and a bag at her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJump under the kneading-trough and hide yourself,\u201d said his mother.</p><p>So in came the old hag.</p><p>\u201cGood day,\u201d said she.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you!\u201d said Buttercup\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your Buttercup at home to-day?\u201d asked the hag.</p><p>\u201cNo, that he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s out in the wood with his father, shooting grouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn it,\u201d said the hag, \u201cfor I had such a nice little silver knife I wanted to give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPip, pip! here I am,\u201d said Buttercup under the kneading-trough, and out he came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so old and stiff in the back,\u201d said the hag, \u201cyou must creep into the bag and fetch it out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>But when Buttercup was well into the bag, the hag threw it over her back and strode off, and when they had gone a good bit of the way, the old hag got tired and asked,</p><p>\u201cHow far is it off to Snoring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf a mile,\u201d answered Buttercup.</p><p>So the hag put down the sack on the road, and went aside by herself into the wood, and lay down to sleep. Meantime Buttercup set to work and cut a hole in the sack with his knife; then he crept out and put a great root of a fir-tree into the sack, and ran home to his mother.</p><p>When the hag got home and saw what there was in the sack, you may fancy she was in a fine rage.</p><p>Next day the old wife sat and baked again, and her dog began to bark, just as he did the day before.</p><p>\u201cRun out, Buttercup, my boy,\u201d said she, \u201cand see what Goldtooth is barking at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I never!\u201d cried Buttercup, as soon as he got out; \u201cif there isn\u2019t that ugly old beast coming again with her head under her arm and a great sack at her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the kneading-trough with you and hide,\u201d said his mother.</p><p>\u201cGood day!\u201d said the hag; \u201cis your Buttercup at home to-day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say he isn\u2019t,\u201d said his mother; \u201che\u2019s out in the wood with his father, shooting grouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bore!\u201d said the hag; \u201chere I have a beautiful little silver spoon I want to give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPip, pip! here I am,\u201d said Buttercup, and crept out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so stiff in the back,\u201d said the old witch, \u201cyou must creep into the sack and fetch it out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>So when Buttercup was well into the sack, the hag swung it over her shoulders and set off home as fast as her legs could carry her. But when they had gone a good bit she grew weary, and asked,</p><p>\u201cHow far is it off to Snoring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mile and a half,\u201d answered Buttercup.</p><p>So the hag set down the sack, and went aside into the wood to sleep a bit, but while she slept Buttercup made a hole in the sack and got out, and put a great stone into it. Now, when the old witch got home, she made a great fire on the hearth, and put a big pot on it, and got everything ready to boil Buttercup; but when she took the sack, and thought she was going to turn out Buttercup into the pot, down plumped the stone and made a hole in the bottom of the pot, so that the water ran out and quenched the fire. Then the old hag was in a dreadful rage, and said, \u201cIf he makes himself ever so heavy next time, he shan\u2019t take me in again.\u201d</p><p>The third day everything went just as it had gone twice before; Goldtooth began to bark, and Buttercup\u2019s mother said to him,</p><p>\u201cDo run out and see what our dog is barking at.\u201d</p><p>So out he went, but he soon came back crying out,</p><p>\u201cHeaven save us! Here comes the old hag again with her head under her arm and a sack at her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJump under the kneading-trough and hide,\u201d said his mother.</p><p>\u201cGood day!\u201d said the hag, as she came in at the door; \u201cis your Buttercup at home to-day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind to ask after him,\u201d said his mother; \u201cbut he\u2019s out in the wood with his father, shooting grouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bore, now,\u201d said the old hag; \u201chere have I got such a beautiful little silver fork for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPip, pip! here I am,\u201d said Buttercup, as he came out from under the kneading-trough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so stiff in the back,\u201d said the hag, \u201cyou must creep into the sack and fetch it out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>But when Buttercup was well inside the sack the old hag swung it across her shoulders, and set off as fast as she could. This time she did not turn aside to sleep by the way, but went straight home with Buttercup in the sack, and when she reached her house it was Sunday.</p><p>So the old hag said to her daughter:</p><p>\u201cNow you must take Buttercup and kill him, and boil him nicely till I come back, for I\u2019m off to church to invite my guests to dinner.\u201d</p><p>So, when all in the house were gone to church, the daughter was to take Buttercup and kill him, but then she didn\u2019t know how to go about it at all.</p><p>\u201cStop a bit,\u201d said Buttercup; \u201cI\u2019ll soon show you how to do it; just lay your head on the chopping-block, and you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d</p><p>So the poor silly thing laid her head down, and Buttercup took an axe and chopped her head off, just as if she had been a chicken. Then he laid her head in the bed, and popped her body into the pot, and boiled it so nicely; and when he had done that, he climbed up on the roof, and dragged up with him the fir-tree root and the stone, and put one over the door, and the other at the top of the chimney.</p><p>So when the household came back from church, and saw the head on the bed, they thought it was the daughter who lay there asleep; and then they thought they would just taste the broth.</p><p>said the old hag.</p><p>said Buttercup down the chimney, but no one heeded him.</p><p>So the old hag\u2019s husband, who was every bit as bad as she, took the spoon to have a taste.</p><p>said he.</p><p>said Buttercup down the chimney pipe.</p><p>Then they all began to wonder who it could be that chattered so, and ran out to see. But when they came out at the door, Buttercup threw down on them the fir-tree root and the stone, and broke all their heads to bits. After that he took all the gold and silver that lay in the house, and went home to his mother, and became a rich man.</p>"}
