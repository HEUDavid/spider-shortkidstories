And everybody cried out: \u00ab\u00a0Give up! Give up! You\u2019ll never get to the top!\u00a0\u00bb Listening repeatedly to these negative words led the frogs to abandon the race after all, except for the one frog that, despite what people were saying, and though alone and with great pain, continued to run and finally reached the top.</p><p>Deeply astonished, the other frogs wanted to know how she had managed to do it. They came to her and asked her what her secret was.</p><p>And it was then that they found out that\u2026 she was deaf!</p><p>Take a healthy life attitude: Never to listen to people who are negative in their intentions. Be deaf to discouraging words and always follow your dreams to the end.</p>"}
