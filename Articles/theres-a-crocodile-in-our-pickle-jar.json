I\u2019ll just have a piece of cake please,\u201d said Alex.</p><p>\u201cAlex, it doesn\u2019t work that way. To get a piece of cake you\u2019ll have to eat your dinner first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll just have to call it a night,\u201d said Alex\u2019s dad. \u201cYou\u2019re excused from the table, Alex.\u00a0 Brush your teeth and get to bed young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Alex.</p><p>As Alex stood up from the table his brother pretended to be flying an airplane.\u00a0 After a bite of chocolate cake made a safe landing in his brother\u2019s mouth, Alex ran out of the room as fast as he could.\u00a0 Being sent to bed without having dessert was tough enough, but being teased by his brother is what really took the cake.</p><p>After he brushed his teeth and climbed into bed, Alex found it hard to fall asleep that night.\u00a0 His stomach roared like an angry lion and he felt dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI am so hungry,\u201d Alex said aloud.</p><p>Alex felt weak.\u00a0 The room was spinning!</p><p>As he made his way to the kitchen, Alex could hardly wait to sneak a nice big piece of chocolate cake. He knew that would make him feel better. But when Alex opened the refrigerator door he was shocked to see a crocodile swimming in a jar of pickles.\u00a0 The crocodile looked mean and appeared ready to attack.\u00a0 Alex slammed the refrigerator door and cried out, \u201cHelp me! Please help me!\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s cry for help woke everyone in his family up. His parents and brother rushed to see what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Alex?\u201d asked Alex\u2019s dad. \u201cWhy are you up at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>Alex hid behind the kitchen table as he pointed to the refrigerator and said, \u201cDaddy, there\u2019s a crocodile in our pickle jar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a what?\u201d asked Alex\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cI saw it! It\u2019s in there,\u201d said Alex. \u201cThere\u2019s a crocodile in our pickle jar!\u201d</p><p>As Alex\u2019s mom and brother joined him behind the kitchen table, Alex\u2019s dad opened the refrigerator door. He grabbed the jar of pickles.</p><p>\u201cPlease get it out of here!\u201d cried Alex.</p><p>Alex\u2019s dad reached into the pickle jar and took a huge bite out of the crocodile.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d said Alex\u2019s dad. \u201cThis isn\u2019t sweet. When did we get dill pickles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Alex. \u201cWhere\u2019s the crocodile? I saw it move. It showed me its teeth.\u201d</p><p>After Alex was reassured everything was okay, his parents reminded him of how important food was for energy. Alex\u2019s empty stomach was why he had felt dizzy and weak; and when you feel that way your eyes can play tricks on you. So you see, there never was a crocodile in the pickle jar that night! The next evening when Alex\u2019s mom told everyone there was plenty of leftover chocolate cake for dessert, Alex was the only one who didn\u2019t want any.\u00a0 He was too stuffed.\u00a0 Three helpings of broccoli will do that.</p>"}
