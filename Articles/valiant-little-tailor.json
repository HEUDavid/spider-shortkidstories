Good jams for sale!\u201d</p><p>This cry sounded nice in the Tailor\u2019s ears, and, poking his small head out of the window, he called, \u201cHere, my good woman, just bring your jams in here!\u201d The woman mounted the three steps up to the Tailor\u2019s house with her large basket, and began to open all the pots together before him. He looked at them all, held them up to the light, smelt them, and at last said, \u201cThese jams seem to me to be very nice, so you may weigh me out two ounces, my good woman; I don\u2019t object even if you make it a quarter of a pound.\u201d</p><p>The woman, who hoped to have met with a good customer, was annoyed he only wanted such a small amount. She gave him all he wished, and went off grumbling, and in a very bad temper.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d exclaimed the Tailor, \u201cHeaven will send me a blessing on this jam, and give me fresh strength\u201d and, taking the bread from the cupboard, he cut himself a slice the size of the whole loaf, and spread the jam upon it. \u201cThat will taste very nice,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, before I take a bite, I will just finish this waistcoat.\u201d</p><p>So he put the bread on the table and stitched away, making larger and larger stitches every time for joy. Meanwhile the smell of the jam rose to the ceiling, where many flies were sitting, and enticed them down, so that soon a great swarm of them had landed on the bread.</p><p>\u201cHello! Who asked you?\u201d exclaimed the Tailor, driving away the uninvited visitors; but the flies, not understanding his words, would not be driven off, and came back in greater numbers than before.</p><p>This put the little man in a great passion, and, snatching up in his anger a bag of cloth, he brought it down with a merciless swoop upon them. When he raised it again he counted as many as seven lying dead before him with outstretched legs. \u201cWhat a fellow you are!\u201d said he to himself, astonished at his own bravery. \u201cThe whole town must hear of this.\u201d In great haste he cut himself out material for a belt, sewed a hem on it and then put on it in large letters, \u201cSEVEN AT ONE BLOW!\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cnot one city alone, the whole world shall hear it!\u201d and his heart danced with joy, like a puppy-dog\u2019s tail.</p><p>The little Tailor put the belt around his body, and made ready to travel into the wide world, feeling the workshop too small for his great deeds. Before he set out, however, he looked about his house to see if there were anything he could carry with him, but he found only an old cheese, which he pocketed, and observing a bird which was caught in the bushes before the door, he captured it, and put that in his pocket also. Soon after he set out boldly on his travels; and, as he was light and active, he didn\u2019t feel tired. His road led him up a hill, and when he arrived at the highest point of it he found a great Giant sitting there, who was gazing about him in a very relaxed manner.</p><p>But the little Tailor went boldly up, and said, \u201cGood day, friend; truly you sit there and see the whole world stretched below you. I also am on my way there to seek my fortune. Are you willing to go with me?\u201d</p><p>The Giant looked with scorn at the little Tailor, and said, \u201cYou rascal! you wretched creature!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d replied the Tailor; \u201cbut here may be seen what sort of a man I am;\u201d and, unbuttoning his coat, he showed the Giant his belt. The Giant read, \u201cSEVEN AT ONE BLOW\u201d; and supposing they were men whom the Tailor had killed, he felt some respect for him. Still he meant to try him first; so taking up a pebble, he squeezed it so hard that water dropped out of it. \u201cDo as well as that,\u201d said he to the other, \u201cif you have the strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it be nothing harder than that,\u201d said the Tailor, \u201cthat\u2019s child\u2019s play.\u201d And, diving into his pocket, he pulled out the cheese and squeezed it until it oozed, and said, \u201cNow, I fancy that I have done better than you.\u201d</p><p>The Giant wondered what to say, and could not believe it of the little man; so, catching up another pebble, he flung it so high that it almost went out of sight, saying, \u201cThere, you pigmy, do that if you can.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/069.png'></img><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d said the Tailor; \u201cbut your pebble will fall down again to the ground. I will throw one up which will not come down;\u201d and, dipping into his pocket, he took out the bird and threw it into the air. The bird, glad to be free, flew straight up, and then far away, and did not come back. \u201cHow does that little performance please you, friend?\u201d asked the Tailor.</p><p>\u201cYou can throw well,\u201d replied the giant; \u201cnow truly we will see if you are able to carry something uncommon.\u201d So saying, he took him to a large oak tree, which lay upon the ground, and said, \u201cIf you are strong enough, now help me to carry this tree out of the forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied the Tailor; \u201cyou may hold the trunk upon your shoulder, and I will lift the boughs and branches, they are the heaviest, and carry them.\u201d</p><p>The Giant took the trunk upon his shoulder, but the Tailor sat down on one of the branches, and the Giant, who could not look round, had to carry the whole tree and also the Tailor. He being behind, was very cheerful, and laughed at the trick, and presently began to sing the song, \u201cThere rode three tailors out at the gate,\u201d as if the carrying of trees were a trifle. The Giant, after he had staggered a very short distance with his heavy load, could go no further, and called out, \u201cDo you hear? I must drop the tree.\u201d The Tailor, jumping down, quickly embraced the tree with both arms, as if he had been carrying it, and said to the Giant, \u201cAre you such a big fellow, and yet cannot you carry a tree by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Then they travelled on further, and as they came to a cherry-tree, the Giant seized the top of the tree where the ripest cherries hung, and, bending it down, gave it to the Tailor to hold, telling him to eat. But the Tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when the Giant let go, the tree flew up in the air, and the Tailor was taken with it. He came down on the other side, however, unhurt, and the Giant said, \u201cWhat does that mean? Are you not strong enough to hold that twig?\u201d \u201cMy strength did not fail me,\u201d said the Tailor; \u201cdo you imagine that that was a hard task for one who has slain seven at one blow? I jumped over the tree simply because the hunters were shooting down here amongst the bushed. Jump after me if you can.\u201d The Giant made the attempt, but could not clear the tree, and stuck fast in the branches; so that in this affair, too, the Tailor had the advantage.</p><p>Then the Giant said, \u201cSince you are such a brave fellow, come with me to my house, and stop a night with me.\u201d The Tailor agreed, and followed him; and when they came to the cave, there sat by the fire two other Giants, each with a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating. The Tailor sat down thinking. \u201cAh, this is very much more like the world than is my workshop.\u201d And soon the Giant pointed out a bed where he could lie down and go to sleep. The bed, however, was too large for him, so he crept out of it, and lay down in a corner. When midnight came, and the Giant fancied the Tailor would be in a sound sleep, he got up, and taking a heavy iron bar, beat the bed right through at one stroke, and believed he had thereby finished off the little Tailor. At the dawn of day the Giants went out into the forest, quite forgetting the Tailor, when up he came, quite cheerful, and showed himself before them. The Giants were frightened, and, dreading he might kill them all, they ran away in a great hurry.</p><p>The Tailor travelled on, always following his nose, and after he had journeyed some long distance, he came into the courtyard of a royal palace; and feeling very tired he laid himself down on the ground and went to sleep. Whilst he lay there the people came and viewed him on all sides, and read upon his belt, \u201cSeven at one blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d they said, \u201cwhat does this great warrior here in time of peace? This must be some valiant hero.\u201d So they went and told the King, knowing that, should war break out, here was a valuable and useful man, worth keeping. The King took advice, and sent one of his courtiers to the Tailor to beg for his fighting services, if he should be awake. The messenger stopped at the sleeper\u2019s side, and waited till he stretched out his limbs and unclosed his eyes, and then he mentioned to him his message. \u201cThat is the reason I came here,\u201d was his answer; \u201cI am quite willing to enter into the King\u2019s service.\u201d Then he was taken away with great honor, and a fine house was appointed him to live in.</p><p>The courtiers, however, became jealous of the Tailor, and wished him at the other end of the world. \u201cWhat will happen?\u201d said they to one another. \u201cIf we go to war with him, when he strikes out seven will fall at one stroke, and nothing will be left for us to do.\u201d In their anger they decided to resign, and they went all together to the King, and asked his permission, saying, \u201cWe are not prepared to keep company with a man who kills seven at one blow.\u201d The King was sorry to lose all his devoted servants for the sake of one, and wished that he had never seen the Tailor, and would gladly have now been rid of him. He dared not, however dismiss him, because he feared the Tailor might kill him and all his subjects, and seat himself upon the throne.</p><p>For a long time he thought about it, till finally he came to a decision; and, sending for the Tailor, he told him that, seeing he was so great a hero, he wished to beg a favor of him. \u201cIn a certain forest in my kingdom,\u201d said the King, \u201cthere are two Giants, who, by murder, plundering, fire, and robbery, have committed great damage, and no one approaches them without endangering his own life. If you kill both these Giants, I will give you my only daughter in marriage, and half of my kingdom, a hundred knights shall accompany you, too, in order to provide you some assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that is something for a man like me,\u201d thought the Tailor to himself: \u201ca lovely Princess and half a kingdom are not offered every day.\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI will soon settle these two Giants, and a hundred horsemen are not needed for that purpose; he who kills seven at one blow has no fear of two.\u201d</p><p>And so, the little Tailor set out, followed by the hundred knights, to whom he said, immediately they came to the edge of the forest, \u201cYou must stay here; I prefer to meet these Giants alone.\u201d</p><p>Then he ran off into the forest, peering about him on all sides; and after a while he saw the two Giants sound asleep under a tree, snoring so loudly that the branches above them shook violently.</p><p>The Tailor, bold as a lion, filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up the tree. When he got to the middle of it he crawled along a branch, so that he sat just above the sleepers, and then he let fall one stone after another upon the body of one of them. For some time the Giant did not move, until, at last awaking, he pushed his companion, and said, \u201cWhy are you hitting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been dreaming,\u201d he answered; \u201cI did not touch you.\u201d So they laid themselves down again to sleep, and presently the Tailor threw a stone down upon the other. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy are you knocking me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not touch you; you are dreaming,\u201d said the first. So they argued for a few minutes; but, both being very weary with the day\u2019s work, they soon went to sleep again. Then the Tailor began his fun again, and, picking out the largest stone, threw it with all his strength upon the chest of the first Giant. \u201cThis is too bad!\u201d he exclaimed; and, jumping up like a madman, he fell upon his companion, who considered himself equally injured, and they they were both so angry that they rooted up trees and beat one another about until they both fell dead upon the ground.</p><p>Then the Tailor jumped down, saying, \u201cWhat a piece of luck they did not pull up the tree on which I sat, or else I would have had to jump on another like a squirrel, for I am not used to flying.\u201d Then he drew his sword, and, cutting a deep wound in the breast of both, he went to the horsemen and said, \u201cThe deed is done; I have given each his death-stroke; but it was a tough job, for in their defence they uprooted trees to protect themselves with; still, all that is of no use when such an one as I come, who slew seven at one stroke.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/074.png'></img><p>\u201cAnd are you not wounded?\u201d they asked.</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me that? they have not injured a hair of my head,\u201d replied the little man. The knights could hardly believe him, till, riding into the forest, they found the Giants lying dead, and the uprooted trees around them.</p><p>Then the Tailor demanded the promised reward of the King; but he repented of his promise, and began to think of some new plan to shake off the hero. \u201cBefore you receive my daughter and the half of my kingdom,\u201d said he to him, \u201cyou must execute another brave deed. In the forest there lives a unicorn that commits great damage, you must first catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear a unicorn less than I did two Giants! Seven at one blow is my motto,\u201d said the Tailor. So he carried with him a rope and an axe and went off to the forest, ordering those, who were told to accompany him, to wait on the outskirts. He had not to hunt long, for soon the unicorn approached, and prepared to rush at him as if it would pierce him on the spot with his horn.</p><p>\u201cSteady! steady!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat is not done so easily\u201d; and, waiting till the animal was close upon him, he sprang behind a tree. The unicorn, rushing with all its force against the tree, stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it could not pull it out again, and so it remained prisoner.</p><p>\u201cNow I have got him,\u201d said the Tailor; and coming from behind the tree, he first bound the rope around its neck, and then cutting the horn out of the tree with his axe, he arranged everything, and, leading the unicorn, brought it before the King.</p><p>The King, however, would not yet deliver over the promised reward, and made a third demand, that, before the marriage, the Tailor should capture a wild boar which did much damage, and he should have the huntsmen to help him.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d was the reply; \u201cit is a mere nothing.\u201d The huntsmen, however, he left behind, to their great joy, for this wild boar had already so often hunted them, that they saw no fun in now hunting it. As soon as the boar noticed the Tailor, it ran at him with gaping mouth and glistening teeth, and tried to throw him down on the ground; but our flying hero sprang into a little chapel which stood near, and out again at a window, on the other side, in a moment. The boar ran after him, but he, skipping around, closed the door behind it, and there the furious beast was caught, for it was much too big and heavy to jump out of the window.</p><p>The Tailor now ordered the huntsmen up, that they might see his prisoner with their own eyes; but our hero presented himself before the King, who was obliged at last, whether he would or no, to keep his word, and surrender his daughter and the half of his kingdom.</p><p>If he had known that it was no warrior, but only a Tailor, who stood before him, it would have grieved him still more.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/076.png'></img><p>So the wedding was celebrated with great magnificence, though with little rejoicing, and out of a Tailor there was made a King.</p><p>A short time afterwards the young Queen heard her husband talking in his sleep, saying, \u201cBoy, make me a coat, and then stitch up these trousers, or you will be in trouble!\u201d Then she understood of what condition her husband was, and complained in the morning to her father, and begged he would free her from her husband, who was nothing more than a tailor. The King comforted her by saying, \u201cThis night leave your chamber-door open: my servants shall stand outside, and when he is asleep they shall come in, tie him up and carry him away to a ship, which shall take him out into the wide world.\u201d</p><p>The wife was pleased with the proposal; but the King\u2019s servant, who had overheard all, went to the young King and revealed the whole plot. \u201cI will soon put an end to this affair,\u201d said the valiant little Tailor. In the evening at their usual time they went to bed, and when his wife thought he was asleep she got up, opened the door, and laid herself down again.</p><p>The Tailor, however, only pretended to be asleep, and began to call out in a loud voice, \u201cBoy, make me a coat, and then stitch up these trousers, oror you will be in trouble. Seven have I slain with one blow, two Giants have I killed, a unicorn have I led captive, and a wild boar have I caught, and shall I be afraid of those who stand outside my room?\u201d</p><p>When the men heard these words spoken by the Tailor, a great fear came over them, and they ran away as if wild huntsmen were following them; neither afterwards dared any man venture to oppose him. In this way, the Tailor became a King, and so he lived for the rest of his life.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/077.png'></img>"}
