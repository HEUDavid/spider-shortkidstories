It\u2019s time to go to school!\u201d Meredith rolls over, looks at the clock and quickly pulls the covers back.</p><p>\u201cAlright. Alright. I\u2019m up!\u201d she yells. Today is Secret Santa in Mrs. Morrow\u2019s 7th grade class and Meredith isn\u2019t what you call \u201cMs. Popular\u201d. She has dreaded this day for the past month, because she knew that she probably wouldn\u2019t get a gift from any of her class mates.</p><p>Dragging her book bag down the stairs, Meredith plops down at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cMom, can\u2019t I just skip school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Meredith, we\u2019ve already had this discussion and it\u2019s not up for replay. You\u2019re going to school. Stop hiding in the shadows and make friends.\u201d</p><p>Meredith rolls her eyes and proceeds to walk out the door. Her mother kisses her forehead and strokes her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s been a rough year, but you\u2019ve got to make an attempt to be comfortable in your new environment. Your dad and I feel this change would be good for the family. Plus, business is better for his jewelry store in this town.\u201d</p><p>Meredith hugs her mom, puts her backpack on and walks down the driveway. Her mom shouts \u201cDid you get your gift for your classmate?\u201d</p><p>Meredith nods and reluctantly hops on the bus.\u00a0 As she sits down, she pulls a white box out of her coat pocket. It has the name Kayla written on it. She sighs, \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and Mrs. Morrow\u2019s class settles down. Kayla, the notorious mean girl laughs with her posse as Meredith sits in her seat. Meredith slouches in her chair and looks away.</p><p>\u201cClass, today is Secret Santa. Does everyone have their gifts to exchange?\u201d In unison, the class replies that they had done so.</p><p>\u201cGreat! So, at this time I\u2019d like for each of you to go ahead and exchange your gifts, while I get our refreshments ready.\u201d</p><p>Meredith takes a hard swallow and slowly gets up from her desk. She makes her way towards Kayla\u2019s desk and gently taps her on the shoulder. Kayla looks up, rolls her eyes, and flips her hair.</p><p>\u201cThis better be good new girl.\u201d Meredith places the white box on her desk and walks away.</p><p>Kayla opens the box and covers her mouth in astonishment. The gold necklace that her dad gave her before he passed away a year ago gently lay in the box repaired, shining like new.\u00a0 She had lost it a month ago in gym class. She never wore it because the clasp had been broken. Meredith walked upon it and took it to her dad\u2019s shop for repair. She figured since she had pulled Kayla\u2019s name for Secret Santa this would be the best opportunity to give it to her, especially since she wouldn\u2019t have had any other reason to even speak to Kayla from being teased so much.</p><p>Kayla gets up from her desk and goes to Meredith.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026.look I\u2019m sorry for giving you such a hard time this past year. This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me. Ever since my dad died, I haven\u2019t really cared about a lot. How\u2019d you get it fixed anyway?\u201d</p><p>Meredith smiles and replies \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I understand the teasing comes with new girl territory, but my dad owns the new jewelry store in town. So, I had him to fix it for me. Free of charge!\u201d Kayla smiles back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool. I had no idea. Thanks again Meredith. This really means a lot.\u201d Kayla walks back to her desk. Meredith grins and looks over to Mrs. Morrow who winks in agreement.</p>"}
