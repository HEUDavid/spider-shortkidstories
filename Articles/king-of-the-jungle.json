Below three\u00a0little lizards gazed upward.</p><p>Gig raised his knobby finger out of the slime and pointed. \u201cI\u2019ll get that banana before you\u00a0blink. I have jumbo-mumbo muscles.\u201d</p><p>Zipper did a pirouette and answered, \u201cYeah but you\u2019re not nimble like me.\u201d</p><p>Sprout\u2019s friends never talked to him. His eyes went back and forth from Gig to Zipper to\u00a0the banana.</p><p>Zipper and Gig continued to point, strut and stick out their chests.</p><p>Branches snapped, twigs cracked and mud squished.</p><p>A crowd of Sloths, Tigers and Turtles began to gather around.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you give to the one who gets the last banana?\u201d asked Gig and Zipper.</p><p>The sloths, tigers and turtles gathered into a huddle.</p><p>The tigers said, \u201cThose branches are too tiny for me. They\u2019ll never make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get droopy easy. Surely they will also,\u201d laughed the sloths.</p><p>The turtles answered, \u201cIf I can\u2019t climb then they can\u2019t climb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we make the prize, king of the jungle?\u201d replied the Tigers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Then we\u2019ll have a good laugh,\u201d they all said.</p><p>The head tiger turned to the Lizards, \u201cThe one who picks the last banana will be crowned\u00a0king of the jungle.\u201d</p><p>Gig\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI want to be King of the jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be King of the jungle,\u201d answered Zipper.</p><p>Sprout said nothing at all.</p><p>Gig and Zipper put themselves in a row. After a while Sprout did also.</p><p>A hush fell over the crowd.</p><p>\u201cThree, two, one- GO!\u201d</p><p>Gig and Zipper sprinted up. Sprout took off after them.</p><p>Below the Sloths yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re getting exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Behind them the Tigers hollered, \u201cYou\u2019re too galumphing for that branch.\u201d</p><p>The Turtles mocked, \u201cStay on the ground. It\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Gig peered at the animals below. They were tiny dots. Fright over-whelmed him. When\u00a0his body began to tremble he lost his grip. Whoosh-whoosh. Down he splashed into the swampy\u00a0waters.</p><p>Zipper saw Gig go flying by. His teeth began to rattle with terror. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d he\u00a0shrieked. Plat-plop. He came spiraling down also and crept into the jungle alone.</p><p>Sprout continued up the tree.</p><p>The Turtles shouted ever louder, \u201cHey, down here! Look down here!\u201d</p><p>The Sloths cried, \u201cIt\u2019s time for your nap.\u201d</p><p>The Tigers shouted, \u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><p>Sprout went higher.</p><p>The crowd increased their yelling.</p><p>The Sloths cried, \u201cYou\u2019ll get snatched by an Eagle up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat branch is gonna snap any second,\u201d said the Tigers.</p><p>The Turtles said, \u201cYou can\u2019t climb trees. Just accept it.\u201d</p><p>Higher and higher and higher and faster and faster and faster he went until there he was\u00a0right at the very tip-top. Sprout grabbed the banana and held it up.</p><p>The crowd roared with applause and stomped their feet.</p><p>Sensitive to vibration Sprout looked down and was surprised to see the creatures below\u00a0cheering.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat at the sight.</p><p>When he came down the animal paparazzi thrust one microphone after another into his\u00a0face.</p><p>\u201cTell us your secret.\u201d</p><p>Sprout smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow did it feel up there?\u201d</p><p>Sprout started to write.</p><p>\u201cWhat kept you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you ever afraid?\u201d</p><p>Their questions went on and on and on.</p><p>When Sprout was finished he handed them the note.</p><p>I am deaf.</p><p>\u201cAttention, attention, announcing the king of the jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake-way, make-way, for the king of the jungle.\u201d</p>"}
