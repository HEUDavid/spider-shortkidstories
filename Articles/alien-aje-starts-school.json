He didn\u2019t want to start school but his parents had told him this was the way of the humans and as they were visiting from another planet they had to do what humans do to fit in.</p><p>\u201cAje, it\u2019s time for you to make human friends now,\u201d his parents told him at breakfast.</p><p>Aje had loads of friends, but no human friends, despite having lived on planet Earth since the day he was born. He wasn\u2019t sure how long his parents had lived on Earth but they often seemed more human than of his own species to him.</p><p>\u201cI have friends, loads of friends, good friends,\u201d Aje protested. It wasn\u2019t his fault no one else could see them.</p><p>\u201cAje, your imaginary friends have served their time, it\u2019s time to become fully human now,\u201d his mum and dad said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be human. I want to keep my friends.\u201d Aje made a sour face and stood up from the table.</p><p>\u201cThey are not imaginary, they are real. I wish you were made up!\u201d Aje shouted and stormed off. He didn\u2019t mean it, but aliens could vent all feelings without other aliens taking it personally. His parents gave him both space and freedom to be the alien he was in an earthly world.</p><p>Aje knew that they were just trying to help him make the adjustment easier. Starting school was his first milestone in becoming human, or at least pretending that he was one too.</p><p>Aje had never been lonely even when he was on his own, that was for humans not aliens. He had always dreaded starting school because he knew he would have to change to fit in. No amount of positive storytelling had changed his mind.</p><p>\u201cThis is Aje,\u201d said his teacher later the same morning. He stood in front of the class who all knew each other from playschool. Aje was glad to hold the hands of two of his good friends. Some boys started whispering straight away. A few girls started giggling. The negative attention made Aje droop, but his friends picked him up and helped him to his seat.</p><p>At first break the whole class gathered around Aje. They started asking questions.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you talk to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you dress like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling all the time?\u201d</p><p>Aje couldn\u2019t answer. He had never seen himself like they did. He didn\u2019t talk to himself. He talked to his friends. He loved colourful clothes. He was always smiling because he was happy. Everyone on his planet was the same. But not here.</p><p>\u201cYou are strange,\u201d said a girl.</p><p>\u201cYes, strange and weird,\u201d said a boy.</p><p>And then everyone laughed; everyone except Aje.</p><p>Everyone in the class started playing tag, but not Aje. No one asked if he wanted to play. Aje was left on his own. His only friends disappeared too as he wasn\u2019t his real self. For the first time in his life Aje wondered who he really was. He didn\u2019t like the feeling of not knowing. At night when he went to his real home he always knew who he was. He was Aje on a mission on planet Earth. But now he couldn\u2019t remember anything. In the short space of a few hours his whole world had been turned up-side down.</p><p>\u201cI wish night time was my day time,\u201d he told his parents when going to bed.</p><p>He thought of his classmates visiting his planet and how strange they would seem to his people, no imaginary friends, no incessant smiling, a strong dislike of his preferred fuel\u2014vegetables, and no talking with trees and no out of party dress up.</p><p>The next day Aje wiped the smile of his face and changed his clothes to more subdued colours and patterns. He also left his imaginary friends at home. His classmates still teased him and left him alone. He was miserable. He wanted to run away from school.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to school anymore,\u201d he told his parents the second evening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get better once your classmates get to know you,\u201d his mum said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to school,\u201d his dad said. His parents were not helpful.</p><p>But nothing changed. No one talked to Aje and his imaginary friends didn\u2019t like school. He felt lonely and unnecessary. At break time he hid behind the old oak tree. Trees were antennas to another world for Aje, his world. As he hugged the tree he tried to remember the reason he had agreed to be born on Earth, the reason he had agreed to be different. He got a faint signal, a whispering of hope from a tree picking up signals from Aje\u2019s real home.</p><p>Aje had never minded being who he was but now he couldn\u2019t understand why he had decided not to be like everyone else. Life would be so much easier if he could just fit in, if he could change and be like everyone else.</p><p>At night when he went home through his dreams, life was sweet. Life was real, but as soon as he woke up and realised he had to play human again he despaired. Each day he shrunk and faded. He might as well not have been there and at that thought Aje decided to be himself again. He liked being who he was, why should he change?</p><p>He decided to take his power back. He\u2019d rather be with his real friends than the one\u2019s forced on him by a dated system. He put on his most colourful clothes and asked his imaginary friends to come with him to school. Together they skipped and jumped and laughed and talked all the way to the school. Instead of going behind the oak tree he greeted the tree from the front, in full view of the school yard, with a big hug.</p><p>In the classroom the teacher told Aje off for laughing in class.</p><p>\u201cMy friend, imaginary friend to you, just said something funny,\u201d Aje shared with the class who laughed but this time he didn\u2019t mind. He laughed too.</p><p>At break time a girl from his class, Ute, came up to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve finally figured out who I am,\u201d Ute said as she popped up from behind the oak tree, making him jump. Aje waited to hear the rest.</p><p>\u201cYou are an alien, and I\u2019m too.\u201d She had always felt odd, different and not quite part of the group. Aje stared at her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cYou inspired me to be myself,\u201d she complimented him, but my dad says only aliens\u2019 talk to themselves and laughs for no good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why it took you so long to make contact?\u201d Aje wondered, closing his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes, please teach me all you know. Please re-introduce me to my imaginary friends,\u201d Ute said as her face flushed red with excitement.</p><p>\u201cThey are not imaginary. They are real.\u201d He had never liked to have to refer to his friends as imaginary.</p><p>\u201cI know. Please,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Aje thought for a while before agreeing.</p><p>He showed her how to hug a tree, how to tune in and listen. He asked his friends to find hers and they did. She started talking and laughing like Aje. She also dressed in colourful clothes that didn\u2019t match.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a match,\u201d they said and their classmates laughed at both of them.</p><p>They skipped together, holding hands and laughing and their classmates found more pleasure than ever in teasing now when there was two of them.</p><p>\u201cCan you see people who are not there too now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he turn you into an alien as well?\u201d</p><p>Ute took Aje\u2019s hand and together they marched past everyone. He forgave her earlier cowardice immediately; in fact he decided they had just met. They bonded in their differentness.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d they both said at the same time and Aje wondered who had been waiting for whom. Aje and Ute played in his home after school. They talked about the universe, wondering if it was really a multiverse.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there are many different versions of the same planets too,\u201d Ute thought out loud and Aje almost cried with happiness at Ute\u2019s outrageous thought tracks.</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many versions it\u2019s still just one,\u201d Aje added his own totally out there theory, and together they laughed like none of them had laughed before.</p><p>Ute stayed for dinner, they had vegetables with vegetables and Ute who never even got her five a day tucked in.</p><p>\u201cWhy can we only go home through our dreams, why can\u2019t we fly? Why can\u2019t we zoom up to our planets like superheroes do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are playing humans, dreams are such a clever way of pretending to be human but still having access to the whole universe. Don\u2019t mock your dream world, it\u2019s your reality.\u201d</p><p>They looked at the night sky while walking to Ute\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Aje shouted, that\u2019s our planet, he started buzzing, whizzing and swaying.</p><p>Ute did too, only she pretended but she was on to a good start as Aje applauded her efforts.</p><p>Some days later a few more classmates came to the oak tree to see what they were doing.</p><p>\u201cHugging trees is a way of talking to other planets, they are like radio antennas,\u201d Aje explained as Ute was still learning.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d some said without laughing, wishing it was true.</p><p>A few more weeks and as the whole class gathered around the oak tree even the teacher came out to see what everyone was doing.</p><p>\u201cHugging a tree and talking with imaginary friends, you are all being very alien like,\u201d she said and everyone broke out in laughter.</p><p>Soon another child started their class. He was small, dressed funny and talked to people no one else could see, no one except Aje and Ute.</p><p>\u201cCome and play after school, Eso.\u201d Aje invited the new boy and everyone else in the class.</p><p>They played hide and seek because that was Aje\u2019s best game, his imaginary friends told him where everyone was hiding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d his classmates shouted but Aje, Ute and Eso who were all on the same team shouted back, \u201cInvite your old imaginary friends back, or if you never had any, create some!\u201d</p><p>Aje was happy, he had made human friends but he had also managed to hold on to his old friends. His imaginary, to others of course, friends were very real and very present only he had learnt to keep the balance, to live on Earth even though he was not from Earth.</p>"}
