The sun was shining into his room through a gap in the curtains. This was was what woke him up, plus the fact that today was his birthday so he was really\u00a0 excited.\u00a0 Last night when he went to bed he was only 7 but today when he woke up he was fully 8 years old. Peter lived with his Mum and Dad, his big brother Brian who was 11, and his baby sister Pamela. His Granny also lived with them in the same house. She was a young Granny, old, but not too old. She could still walk and run, make her own breakfast and go the shops. Her name was Mella. They also had a white cat called Binky. Binky was really their Granny\u2019s cat but they all just thought of Binky as the family cat. She swished the end of her tail all the time. Peter always wondered why and used to try to grab it. Binky didn\u2019t like it when he did this and usually ran off and hid under Granny\u2019s armchair when he did.</p><p>Peter jumped out of bed and ran downstairs in in his pyjamas. Nobody else was up yet. No school today, great. It was Saturday but tomorrow would be even better as his mum had arranged a birthday party for him at their house. He had invited all his friends from school and some from his road as well. It was going to be a great party. His Granny had a friend who was a magician who was coming along to perform at the party and Peter was looking forward to all the cool presents he was going to get too.</p><p>The next day came and Peter could hardly wait for 3 o\u2019clock to come when his party was going to start. Eventually it did come and the doorbell started to ring. One by one his friends arrived with either their mum or their dad and each holding a present in their hand for Peter as they came in. His mum had bought lots of treats, crisps, pizza and fizzy drinks for the party. They played games which their Dad had organised, played pass the parcel and then the magician came. He was really good. Peter had seen magicians before and their tricks weren\u2019t that good but this one did some tricks that looked like real magic. Everyone filled up on pizza and treats and he got lots of great presents from his friends which he loved but he was given a strange pair of pyjamas as a present by his Granny. When he opened the present first he didn\u2019t really like them. They were kind of old fashioned pyjamas which were light green and had small pictures of racing cars, motorbikes and aeroplanes all over them. Not like all the other pyjamas that Peter had.</p><p>That evening after the party was over Peter was really tired. Before going to bed he asked his mum for a glass of milk. He drank half of it and then fell asleep on the couch before he could manage to get up the stairs to his room. After a few minutes his mum woke him up and had to carry him up stairs to bed. He took out the new pyjamas that his Granny had given him and looked at them again. When he tried them on, he changed his mind immediately about the new pyjamas because they were really cosy and fluffy inside. Even more so than other new pyjamas. Almost tingly. Peter got into bed. It was a cold night so when his Mum kissed him good night, he snuggled up tight and quickly went fast asleep.</p><p>Peter had a lots of dreams about his birthday party that night but then in the middle of the night a very strange thing happened. Peter sat up in bed and put his feet out of bed onto the floor, then stood up. Peter did not know anything about what he was doing because even though he had got up and got out of bed, he was still sound asleep. He slowly started to walk around the room but still didn\u2019t wake up. It was like he was sleepwalking, but he wasn\u2019t moving his legs himself. It was as if the pyjamas were making his legs do the walking. He walked over to the door and his arm lifted up, his hand grabbed the door handle and opened the door. The pyjamas were doing the movement of his arms and hands as well and he walked out the door and down the hallway to Brian\u2019s room.</p><p>He walked into the room and over to Brian\u2019s bed. Brian was lying there fast asleep. He went to the end of the bed and put his hand under the duvet and tickled Brian\u2019s foot. Brian jumped a bit in the bed but did not wake up. There was a chest of drawers underneath the window where their Mum put all of Brian\u2019s clothes. Peter went over and pulled out one of the drawers. He began to pull things out of the drawer and throw them all over the room, but he still did not wake up. He did the same to the next drawer and then the third drawer until all of the drawers were empty and Brian\u2019s clothes were scattered all over the room. Peter then went back to his own room and went back to bed.</p><p>The next morning Peter woke up to the sound of his Mother\u2019s voice. She had gone to wake Brian up for school but let out a loud shriek when she opened his door and saw the state of his room.</p><p>\u201cBrian, what have you been doing?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Brian woke up startled and looked around the room. He saw all the clothes thrown around everywhere and their Mother was standing in the doorway scolding him for having his room in such a mess.</p><p>\u201cBut Mum,\u201d said Brian \u201cI didn\u2019t make this mess, I don\u2019t know how it happened. They certainly weren\u2019t there last night when I went to bed.\u201d There was even a pair of underpants hanging off the lampshade.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was Peter who did it,\u201d said Brian.</p><p>\u201cNonsense\u201d said their mother, \u201cPeter went to bed long before you last night, how could he have done it?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t know that it was actually him who made the mess in Brian\u2019s room so he thought this was all rather funny and that Brian must have done it when he was having one of his tantrums.</p><p>\u201cPlease start putting your clothes back into the drawers Brian\u201d said their Mum, \u201cand hurry up or you will be late for school.\u201d</p><p>Brian was not happy about having to put all of his clothes back himself because he knew he wasn\u2019t the one who had taken them out and scattered them around in the first place. He knew the only other person who could have done it was Peter, but he also knew Peter would never get up in the middle of the night to do it, he couldn\u2019t figure it out at all.</p><p>It took ages to put all the clothes back again, then he had to get dressed and wolf down his breakfast really quickly to catch the school bus.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hurry up\u201d said the driver.</p><p>Peter was already on the bus as it waited outside their house. He watched Brian come running out the front door and jump onto the bus as it was just about to drive off. He almost got squeezed between the doors as they were closing. That was close one, thought Peter.</p><p>That afternoon when Peter got home from school, he had his dinner and quickly finished off his homework, Later\u00a0 that evening when he was going to bed he couldn\u2019t wait to put on the new pyjamas again so at bedtime he ran upstairs, pulled off his clothes and put the pyjamas on as quick as a flash. He got into bed, snuggled up in his duvet and kissed his Mum good night. Pretty soon he fell fast asleep just as he usually did.</p><p>That night much later on, when it was deep in the middle of the night, the same thing happened again. Peter sat up in bed and put his feet out onto the floor. He stood up and got out of bed, but again he did not wake up. The pyjamas were moving all of his body parts just like before and he walked out the door. This time he walked across the hall to his parents room. The door was slightly open, He pushed the door, slowly walked in and went to the end of the bed on his Dad\u2019s side. He put his hand under the covers and tickled Dad\u2019s foot. His Dad grunted and mumbled something but fell back asleep again. Of course Peter did not realise that he was doing any of this because he stayed fast asleep the whole time. It was the pyjamas again that were making him do all of this. He went over to the chair where his Dad had left all his clothes the night before. He put his hand inside one of the trouser pockets and had a feel about. These pyjamas were making him do very strange and mischievous things indeed.</p><p>Inside the pocket were a bunch of keys and some money. Peter took the keys which were the keys of his Dad\u2019s car. He went downstairs and out the front door into the driveway where their car was parked. He pressed the button on the key ring which opened the car doors and got into the drivers seat. Peter was only 8 years old and had never driven a car before. He didn\u2019t even know how to drive but strangely the pyjamas were making him do all the things which you need to do to drive a car.</p><p>He put the key into the ignition and started the engine. He backed the car out of the driveway and drove off down the road towards town. The noise of the car engine starting woke his Dad up. His Dad leapt out of bed just in time to see the car going out the gate and speeding away. He had no idea that it was Peter who was in the car or that it was the pyjamas that were making him drive the car. He shouted at Peter\u2019s Mum to wake her and tell her what was going on.</p><p>Both his parents ran downstairs in their dressing gowns and out onto the road but the car had driven off around the bend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling the Police,\u201d said his Dad as they raced back in to the house, and were met by Brian and Pamela running down the stairs. Their dad\u2019s shouts had woken them up.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d asked their dad, but when they went back upstairs to look for him, he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Dad picked up the phone and immediately called the police to tell them that their car had been stolen and that their little boy Peter was also missing from the house. The policeman on the phone said that they would send somebody around to the house immediately to investigate, and that they would send out a police car to look for Peter and the stolen car.</p><p>A little while later there was a loud knock on the door. It was a tall policeman with a peaked cap and red hair. Their Granny Mella and Binky were now up out of bed, also woken up by all the commotion in the house. The policeman asked some questions like what type of car it was and what Peter looked like and what age he was so that they could try to find Peter and the stolen car. The policeman radioed the station back to give them the information about Peter and the car.</p><p>\u201cSo be on the lookout for an 8 year old boy with dark brown hair, wearing green pyjamas, and the car is a Blue Ford Focus, \u201907 reg. , over,\u201d said the policeman.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nice man,\u201d said their Granny, listening to the policeman as he spoke into his radio.</p><p>Soon afterwards when the policeman had finished asking all the questions he left and said goodnight to them. He told Peter\u2019s parents that he would phone them back when he had found out anything about the missing boy or the stolen car. Peter\u2019s Mum put on some soup and made some toast for everybody, as it was a cold night out. She lit the fire and they all stayed up and sat in the living room eating their soup and toast and waiting for the police to phone back.</p><p>A few hours passed by. Their Granny Mella had nodded off to sleep in her armchair after finishing her soup. Binky still sat on her lap swishing her tail as usual. Pamela and Brian eventually nodded off as well but their parents stayed awake waiting for any news of Peter or their car. A few minutes after the clock struck 4am, the phone rang. Pamela and Brian woke up suddenly and their Dad picked up the phone. It was the nice policeman with the red hair phoning back with some news about Peter and the stolen car. Everyone was quiet in the room. The only one who spoke was their Dad who was saying \u201cyes\u201d over and over again while listening carefully to the policeman on the other end of the phone. After what seemed like ages he said \u201cthank you\u201d and put the phone down.</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d said their Dad. \u201cPeter and our car have been found, the police are on their way\u00a0 over here again to bring me down to the station. Peter and the car are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d asked everybody all together at once.</p><p>\u201cYes he fine but he was very lucky,\u201d replied their Dad. \u201cThe policeman said he was a bit cold in only his pyjamas and he has had a bit of an accident and doesn\u2019t remember much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked their mother who was shaking when she heard the news.</p><p>\u201cThe police found our car with Peter in it on the bypass just outside of town. They said the car had been driven off the road and into the ditch just before the roundabout. The strangest thing is that when they found the car they discovered Peter in the driving seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d everyone gasped, and at the same time the doorbell rang once more. It was the police again but a different policeman this time, one who wasn\u2019t in uniform.</p><p>\u201cBring some clothes in a bag for him to change into,\u201d said their Mum, \u201cit\u2019s freezing out, and bring his coat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll phone back with any news,\u201d said their dad as he left with the Policeman.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the strangest thing I have ever heard,\u201d said their Granny as she stood up. \u201cThank goodness Peter is safe anyway, I\u2019m going back to bed\u201d she said. \u201cCome on Binky\u201d.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Dad ran inside as soon as the police car pulled up outside the the station.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked as he nearly tripped over a large Alsatian dog who was lying near the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWOOF!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d said the policeman on duty. It was the one with the red hair this time standing behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d shouted Peter when he saw his Dad bursting in through the door still in his dressing gown and slippers.</p><p>Peter jumped up from where he was sitting and threw his arms around his Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I don\u2019t know what happened.\u00a0 All I remember is waking up in our car and it was moving, and I was driving it, and next thing it turned off the road and into the ditch and stopped with a bump beside a tree, and\u2026 and\u2026 \u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK Peter,\u201d said his Dad. \u201cThe main thing is that you are safe and you\u2019re not hurt. I was so worried about you , we were all worried sick\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I got into the car, or how I started it or how it was moving,\u201d said Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026,\u201d said his Dad in a puzzled tone.\u201d \u201cThen when it stopped, I just sat there for ages it seemed until the Police car came along and found me,\u201d\u00a0 said Peter. \u201cDad was I driving the car? I don\u2019t know how to drive\u2026 do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d said his Dad.</p><p>\u201cIts funny,\u201d said Peter. \u201cIt was weird but I wasn\u2019t really scared at all, and I wasn\u2019t cold either. Just when I woke up for a second, but then when the car stopped I was OK again. Then I just sat and waited, then the police\u00a0 arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said his Dad. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve brought some clothes over for you, and your coat. Let\u2019s get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>They went into the waiting room, a room with some brown armchairs and a coffee table. There was a TV on the wall with the News on but the sound was turned down. Peter changed out of his pyjamas and gave them to his Dad.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d said his dad, \u201cthose pyjamas look familiar.\u201d</p><p>Peter said nothing. He carried on getting dressed, just thinking his Dad meant that he\u2019d seen the same pyjamas on Peter earlier on.</p><p>\u201cOh never mind,\u201d he said, and he put the pyjamas into the bag that the clothes had been in and handed it back to Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou finish getting dressed, I\u2019m going to have a look at the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Dad.\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat\u201d?</p><p>The car, its fine\u201d said Peter. \u201cThe police drove it back over here and I heard the red haired guy saying it seems fine.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s Dad went out to speak to the Policeman on duty at the desk.</p><p>\u201cThe car seems fine,\u201d said the policeman, \u201cI gave it a quick check over before I drove it back here. Your boy was very lucky. Does he have a driving license then?\u201d \u2013 half joking, half serious.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Peter\u2019s Dad, \u201cobviously not, he\u2019s only 8. He says he doesn\u2019t remember anything until the car went off the road, then he woke up he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been sleep walking,\u201d said the policeman.</p><p>\u201cYes, and sleep driving obviously,\u201d said Peter\u2019s Dad. The policeman gave a little snigger.</p><p>\u201cWell if he\u2019s OK, and the car is OK then there\u2019s no harm done,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll say no more about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said Peter\u2019s Dad to the policeman. \u201cThank you for all your help and for looking after Peter\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t mention,\u201d it replied the policeman.</p><p>\u201cPee \u2013 terrr\u201d\u2026 shouted his Dad from the hallway, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Peter picked up the bag with the pyjamas in it and ran out to the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHere are your keys,\u201d said the policeman. \u201cThanks again,\u201d replied Peter\u2019s dad.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Peter to the red haired policeman as they were leaving.</p><p>\u201cYou mind yourself young man,\u201d he said back. \u201cI will,\u201d said Peter</p><p>\u201cAnd no more sleepwalking or driving cars in your sleep either.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that I knew how to drive,\u201d Peter replied in a confused sort of way. The policeman smiled then went back to working on his computer. His Dad phoned their house to let everyone know that Peter was safe and well and that they were on their way home.</p><p>\u201dEverything is OK,\u201d Peter heard him say,\u00a0 \u201cdon\u2019t wait up for us, Bye.\u201d</p><p>As Peter and his Dad drove home it was starting to get bright.\u00a0 It was just daybreak and the brightest stars were still out.\u00a0 It was a while before either one said anything. Dad was the first one to speak.</p><p>\u201cThat was all very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very puzzled by everything that happened, and how you managed to do all those things without really knowing how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Peter, \u201cI\u2019m pretty puzzled myself. Honest Dad, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and I can\u2019t remember anything about it up until the car stopped with a bump, like I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>After a while his Dad said \u201cwell we\u2019re nearly home now,\u00a0 I think you should go back to bed for a while to see if you can get some sleep. You\u2019ve had a very busy night for an 8 year old.\u201d</p><p>The car came to a stop outside their house. Peter reached into the back seat to get the bag with the pyjamas. They went inside, the house was quiet, everyone had gone back to bed. A very tired Peter climbed the stairs up to his room and let himself fall back on his bed. Within what must have been only a few seconds he had fallen fast asleep \u2013 but with all of his clothes on this time.</p><p>The next morning at breakfast Peter had quite a story to tell the rest of his family. He told them everything about how he woke up in the car not knowing how to drive and how his Dad was so worried about him. When he had finished telling his story, his Granny asked him how he liked the new pyjamas that she had given him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really nice Granny, really nice and cosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I know someone who didn\u2019t like them very much at all,\u201d she said, while giving a glaring look towards their father, who took no notice at the time.</p><p>She then told the surprising story of how that magician friend had given the pyjamas to Peter\u2019s father as an 8 year old boy but he didn\u2019t like them. In fact he hated them so much that he never wore them.</p><p>\u201cBecause they were still new I kept them,\u201d she said, \u201cand waited till they fitted you Peter\u201d.</p><p>There was silence in the room for a few moments. Lots of things were going through Peter\u2019s head just then. He had this feeling that there was some sort of connection between him doing all the strange things last night and the even stranger pyjamas.</p><p>Peter paused for a minute and then he said \u201cI think I\u2019ll wear different pyjamas tonight mum, if that,s OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d his Dad said loudly, before his mum could reply\u2026</p>"}
