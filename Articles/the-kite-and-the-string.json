I\u2019d much prefer to be out working. I could be earning money already. If I started working now at a restaurant like Big Chicken Al\u2019s Wing Hut I\u2019d be earning good wages, good tips and I\u2019d be able to travel and see the world like you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat age are you Alex?\u201d asked Grandpa, frowning. \u201cI am so forgetful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fifteen, Grandpa. Old enough to know when I\u2019m wasting my time. I want to be free from having to go to school every day. Such a waste of time. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m stuck here for another three years. I\u2019d like to be up and away! \u201d</p><p>Grandpa smiled across at Alex and looked at him a moment. \u201cIt reminds me of a story I once heard \u2013 an old folk-tale from China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Alex. \u201cAnother tale with a deep and inner meaning meant to teach me that going to school is actually a good thing?\u201d</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>\u201cListen, and you decide,\u201d said Grandpa.</p><p>\u201cOk Confucius, Grasshopper is listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Good. Once long ago in China, there was a kite. This kite was a large and proud kite and it took much pleasure from being the biggest and high-flying kite in the region.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, a kite with an ego problem,\u201d interrupted Alex.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/kite.jpg'></img><p>\u201cYes, a kite with attitude,\u201d responded Grandpa with a grin. \u201cThis kite enjoyed nothing more than to soar high into the air, higher that any other kites. It longed to go higher and higher, tugging at the string until there was no more to let out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kite with altitude,\u201d quipped Alex.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Although it wasn\u2019t altogether happy. Although it soared higher than all the other kites, it longed to go higher. MUCH higher. It saw the clouds and the birds way above and resented not being able to get up there. In fact it blamed the string for holding it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wanted a no-strings-attached relationship?\u201d offered Alex.</p><p>Grandpa stopped and examined Alex. \u201cAre you taking this seriously or are you going to throw in gags all the way through?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied Alex. \u201cGotta keep the audience entertained grand-pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore that. OK, so this kite,\u201d continued Grandpa, \u201cit really resented the string and complained bitterly whenever the string would stop it from flying higher and higher. The string was not happy with this situation and thought it was unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the string highly strung?\u201d gagged Alex.</p><p>\u201cYes, but only in the manual sense,\u201d replied Grandpa, deliberately ignoring the bad pun. \u201cIt was usually a relaxed string normally, but didn\u2019t like all this grief it was getting from the kite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the highly-strung string stung by the stinging criticism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. It felt it was undeserved and wanted revenge. So one day, the wind was particularly strong. Almost a gale. The kite ascended rapidly as the string was let out quickly. It wasn\u2019t long before the string hit its limit and the kite rose no more.</p><p>\u2018Aw, not again, string!\u2019 bellowed the kite to the string. \u2018Stop holding me back you long streak of killjoy misery! Let me go higher this once. Let go of me!\u2019</p><p>Well the string had had enough. Normally it would hold on in the face of all the wind pressure to make sure the kite stayed attached. The string let go and dropped towards the earth, no longer pulled up by the kite.</p><p>\u2018So long sucker!\u2019 exclaimed the kite as it burst upwards on a gust of wind. And what do you think happened next Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoh \u2013 the kite rose up above the clouds and said hello to the birdies \u2013 \u2018Hi my name is Kite and I\u2019m new around here, will you play with me?\u2019 Oh no, sorry, without the string attached, it dropped to the ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly Alex. Without the tension of the string holding it, the air pressure no longer had the resistance of the string to create lift and instead the kite dropped quite quickly down. When it hit the ground quite hard, one of its struts bore the brunt of the landing and cracked. The kite was badly injured.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/kite-on-the-ground.jpg'></img><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t able to strut its stuff no more?\u201d asked Alex.</p><p>\u201cWell, not for a while. It was sent to the repair shop where they fixed it up with a new strut and was right as rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it learned its lesson that it needed the string to fly and was happy ever after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. It was too proud to learn the lesson and never forgave the string for its behaviour. It still complained to the string of holding him back. Do you see the lesson in this for your situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES! Thanks Grandpa! I understand now,\u201d exclaimed Alex.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d replied Grandpa, uncertain of the newfound enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d continued Alex. \u201cI should leave school and learn how to fly and repair kites. And I should get some extra long string so that my kite can fly higher and higher. No, wait, the string is really money you want to give me money so that my kite, that is my future success, can be as high as possible! Thanks Grandpa. You can transfer it directly to my bank account.\u201d Alex folded his arms and looked smugly at Grandpa.</p><p>\u201cEh, that\u2019s not exactly what I was\u2026.\u201d started Grandpa.</p><p>\u201cOK, I know,\u201c confessed Alex. \u201cI\u2019m just yankin\u2019 your chain. What the story is actually saying is that sometimes you need constraints in order to reach your potential. Sometimes it\u2019s the things that you think are holding you back are actually mostly responsible for your growth. The string is having to finish school and the kite is my future potential being realised. And the wind is my education lifting me higher and higher.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa smiled back. \u201cExactly, Alex. Well done. I thought for a while you were not taking this seriously, but now I see that you have taken in the main lesson of this story. I am proud of you, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Gramps. You\u2019re the best.\u201d Alex got up and hugged his grandfather right then in the chair. \u201cI\u2019m going in now for a bite, I\u2019m starvin\u2019.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Alex-and-grandfather.jpg'></img><p>As Alex left the porch Grandpa had a satisfied smile on his face, happy in the knowledge that he had imparted his wisdom on the boy.\u201cJust one thing Grandpa?\u201d said Alex, coming back out from inside the porch door.</p><p>\u201cYes Alex,\u201d replied Grandpa.</p><p>\u201cIf school is the string and the kite is my potential, when school runs out, am I not stuck at that level?\u201c</p><p>Grandpa furrowed his brow and scratched his chin.</p><p>\u201cNo Alex, you will just need to find your own string I guess.\u201d</p>"}
