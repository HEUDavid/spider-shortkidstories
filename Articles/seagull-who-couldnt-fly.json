I watched my brothers begin to fly from the rooftops\u00a0and explore the nearby trees and open spaces. As hard as I tried to\u00a0copy their actions my wings would just not open to enable me to fly.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image013.png'></img><p>Weeks later I again watched my brothers begin to fly from the rooftops and explore the nearby trees\u00a0and gardens.\u00a0 Mother had been very protective of her baby gulls but she told us we would soon have to search for\u00a0our own food and to be aware of all the hazards that life would present to us.</p><p>I remember falling from the rooftop to the ground in an attempt to fly. Fortunately I landed on my\u00a0feet!! By this time Mother and brothers had fled from the nest telling me that if I didn\u2019t open my\u00a0wings and fly then I would not survive. It wasn\u2019t my fault that my wings would not open \u2013 they just\u00a0remained tucked into my side no matter how hard I tried to spread them.</p><p>I fell to the ground in an attempt to fly. Fortunately I landed on my feet!\u00a0I soon realised that I would never be able to fly and finally admitted that I was different to other\u00a0seagulls. I now had to build my life around my flying problem and survive as best as I could.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/traffic.gif'></img><p>The small fishing town I had been born into boasted a very pretty harbour. I felt if I could find my\u00a0way to the town centre then the harbour would be a good place to live. It was getting near to\u00a0Christmas and I definitely had to\u00a0find a warm and safe place to\u00a0settle. After trying many different roads and only\u00a0finding ploughed fields and open spaces I finally\u00a0could smell the sea! Walking along the pavements many people would \u201cshoo\u201d me away as if I was\u00a0an alien from out of space who was about to attack them!</p><p>I tried walking on the road but the cars would beep their horns and point their front wheels in my\u00a0direction as if to say \u201cfor goodness sake fly away\u201d. How could they possibly know that I couldn\u2019t\u00a0fly?</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image010.gif'></img><p>After many hours of walking I finally arrived at the harbour. How busy it was! I seemed to be in everybody\u2019s way. All I could see was people\u2019s feet!\u00a0I bumped into people pushing prams and people walking dogs.\u00a0I tried so hard to leave the ground.\u00a0There appeared to be more room in the sky but my wings would\u00a0still not unfold.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image008.gif'></img><p>I found a hiding place underneath a wooden bench.\u00a0I felt quite safe and happy until a group of children\u00a0came and sat on the bench and started eating fish and chips. How hungry that made me feel.</p><p>Shrieks of laughter came from the children when a seagull\u00a0(could it have been my brother?) swooped down and\u00a0helped himself to their lunch!\u00a0I didn\u2019t stand a chance of getting any food because I couldn\u2019t escape into the sky.</p><p>In the harbour background I could see a fishing trawler bringing in its catch.\u00a0Circling all around the boat were many seagulls calling out to each other as they smelt the fish.\u00a0This is what I should be doing \u2013 up there in the sky circling around with them.</p><p>As I watched I remembered how my mother had christened me \u201cStupid Seagull\u201d\u00a0She kept telling me I needed to fly to survive. No matter how hard I tried my wings would not open.\u00a0It was almost like they did not exist.\u00a0I needed to move away from the harbour as I was getting tramped on by people in a hurry all\u00a0carrying their Christmas shopping. They did not understand why I remained on the ground.\u00a0If only I could tell them.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image012.gif'></img><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The harbour was surrounded by stone built cottages.\u00a0Twinkling lights were shining from windows to celebrate Christmas.\u00a0As I hopped on to the garden wall of a cottage painted bright yellow and blue\u00a0a voice called out \u201cHello little seagull. My name is Katie \u2013 have you come to visit me?\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image016.gif'></img><p>I looked into the kind face of a lady sitting in a wheelchair hugging a small dog.\u00a0The wheelchair was placed just inside an open glass door separating the garden\u00a0from the house. Inside I could see a large open fire. Beside the fire stood an\u00a0enormous Christmas tree decorated so brightly. The shining star on the top\u00a0appeared to smile at me. I knew then that I was safe.</p><p>The lady threw me a crust of bread from a plate on her lap.\u00a0At last I had food! I was so grateful.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you will fly away now that you have food\u201d said Katie, \u201cevery other seagull does.\u201d\u00a0Katie would soon find out how different I was!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image020.gif'></img><p>Katie\u2019s garden had several shady spots and each night I would snuggle down amongst the shrubs.\u00a0In the morning I would tap my beak on Katie\u2019s glass door to let her know I had not flown away.\u00a0Katie would respond by opening the glass door and throwing food out for me.\u00a0We seemed to make a good pair \u2013 Katie unable to walk and me unable to fly!</p><p>On Christmas day Katie invited me inside her lovely cottage. By this time her little\u00a0dog (Patch) and I had become great friends. We were both given lots of treats\u00a0to celebrate Christmas. There was even a colourful stocking with our names on. I\u00a0didn\u2019t realise she had named me Sammy!</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image022.gif'></img><p>Katie was so kind.\u00a0I had everything I wanted here in Katie\u2019s lovely garden.\u00a0I had at last found a good friend who kept calling me her \u201cSpecial Seagull.\u201d\u00a0I was not a \u201cstupid seagull\u201d after all!</p>"}
