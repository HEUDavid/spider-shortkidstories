Trisha pressed her freckled nose against the living room window. No snow \u2013 only straw-colored ground.</p><p>\u201cIs it snowing yet?\u201d asked her sister, Amy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Trisha. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if it were I\u2019d tell everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your coats, girls. We\u2019re going to get our Christmas tree,\u201d said their dad.</p><p>\u201cOh, goody,\u201d replied Trisha.</p><p>\u201cSomebody help me find my coat,\u201d yelled Amy.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry up,\u201d said Trisha. Every year at Christmastime, Trisha, Amy, and their mom and dad went to a tree farm. It was a family tradition.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get our tree I thought we\u2019d do some Christmas shopping,\u201d said their mother.</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d answered their dad.</p><p>Amy\u2019s dark eyes beamed, \u201cMaybe we can get some candy canes.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the mall, Christmas was everywhere. Frosty the Snowman was playing on the loud speaker; candy canes and Christmas ornaments were hanging all around.</p><p>\u201cCan we look in the toy department for a while?\u201d asked Trisha.</p><p>\u201cIf you girls promise to stay there and wait for us,\u201d answered Dad. Trisha and Amy took off and went from toy to toy. Overhead a sparkling vision caught Trisha\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cOh, Amy,\u201d she squealed as her blond ponytail dangled, \u201clook at the beautiful, silver tree.\u201d The bubbling Christmas lights gave the silver tree a magical look. \u201cHow it sparkles,\u201d Trisha announced. \u201cI wonder if we can buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want a silver tree,\u201d Amy said. Just then Trisha saw her parents. She ran toward them and shouted \u201cMom, Dad, look up here. Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pine tree will be beautiful also,\u201d said Mom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s prettier than any green one. Can we buy it, please?\u201d asked Trisha.</p><p>Dad looked at Mom, \u201cWell,\u201d he said and his voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cTrisha, dear, we always get a pine tree,\u201d replied her mom.</p><p>\u201cPlease, can\u2019t we buy this silver one instead,\u201d begged Trisha.</p><p>\u201cTrisha, our Christmas tradition is that we get a live tree,\u201d said her dad and he turned and walked toward the cash register. As they left the department store, Trisha felt a lump in her throat. No silver tree and no snow.</p><p>When they arrived at the tree farm, Trisha didn\u2019t want to walk around. Her father talked to her about Christmas spirit. He put his arm around her narrow shoulders, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to hurry,\u201d he said as he put on his gloves. \u201cIt looks like it might snow.\u201d</p><p>When they found just the right tree, their dad cut it and tied it to the top of their car. \u201cThe smell of pine is awful. I think I\u2019m going to get sick,\u201d said Trisha.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t smell it inside the car,\u201d answered Amy.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d replied Trisha. When they arrived home, Trisha said grumpily, \u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d She lay down on her bed. She wondered how she could get her mom and dad to change their minds. A little later when their dad walked passed Trisha\u2019s bedroom he found a piece of notepaper on the floor. He picked it up and read: Today I saw the most beautiful silver tree. I made a wish that we could get it for Christmas. </p><p>The following day Trisha and her Girl Scout troop went to help the seniors in the nursing home decorate a Christmas tree and wrap presents. After that they sang Christmas carols.</p><p>Trisha couldn\u2019t help but notice the smiles when she handed out ornaments to a woman in a wheelchair. She thought about the silver tree. I guess Dad\u2019s right, she thought. Christmas is really sharing. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of tree you have. It\u2019s what\u2019s in your heart that counts</p><p>The next evening after dinner their dad called out, \u201cGirls, it\u2019s time to decorate the tree. \u201cI\u2019ve already put on the new lights. Let\u2019s get the ornaments and start decorating.\u201d</p><p>When Trisha walked into the living room, her eyes opened wide. Instead of a green pine tree there stood a handsome silver tree. Trisha ran past a can of silver spray paint. \u201cOh, daddy,\u201d she said, \u201ca silver pine tree. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Outside a soft dusting of white snow could be seen. Maybe wishes really came true after all.</p>"}
