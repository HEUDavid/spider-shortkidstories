It was a large shell with many points upon it. These were coarse and rough, but the shell was most beautiful inside.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-089.jpg'></img><p>Marcella had seen the shell time and time again and often admired its lovely coloring, which could be seen when one looked inside the shell.</p><p>So one day, Gran\u2019ma gave the beautiful shell to Marcella to have for her very own, up in the nursery.</p><p>\u201cIt will be nice to place before the nursery door so the wind will not blow the door and pinch anyone\u2019s fingers!\u201d Gran\u2019ma laughed.</p><p>So Marcella brought the shell home and placed it in front of the nursery door. Here the dolls saw it that night, when all the house was still, and stood about it wondering what kind of toy it might be.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be nearly all mouth!\u201d said Henny, the Dutch doll. \u201cPerhaps it can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has teeth!\u201d the French doll pointed out. \u201cIt may bite!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe it will bite,\u201d Raggedy Andy mused, as he got down upon his hands and knees and looked up into the shell. \u201cMarcella would not have it up here if it would bite!\u201d And, saying this, Raggedy Andy put his rag arm into the lovely shell\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bite! I knew it wouldn\u2019t!\u201d he cried. \u201cJust feel how smooth it is inside!\u201d</p><p>All the dolls felt and were surprised to find it polished so highly inside, while the outside was so coarse and rough. With the help of Uncle Clem and Henny, Raggedy Andy turned the shell upon its back, so that all the dolls might look in.</p><p>The coloring consisted of dainty pinks, creamy whites and pale blues, all running together just as the coloring in an opal runs from one shade into another. Raggedy Andy, stooping over to look further up inside the pretty shell, heard something.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s whispering!\u201d he said, as he raised up in surprise.</p><p>All the dolls took turns putting their ears to the mouth of the beautiful shell. Yes, truly it whispered, but they could not catch just what it said.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-092.jpg'></img><p>Finally Raggedy Andy suggested that all the dolls lie down upon the floor directly before the shell and keep very quiet.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a sound we may be able to hear what it says!\u201d he explained.</p><p>So the dolls lay down, placing themselves flat upon the floor directly in front of the shell and where they could see and admire its beautiful coloring.</p><p>Now the dolls could be very, very quiet when they really wished to be, and it was easy for them to hear the faint whispering of the shell.</p><p>This is the story the shell told the dolls in the nursery that night:</p><p>\u201cA long, long time ago, I lived upon the yellow sand, deep down beneath the blue, blue waters of the ocean. Pretty silken sea weeds grew around my home and reached their waving branches up, up towards the top of the water.</p><p>\u201cThrough the pretty sea weeds, fishes of pretty colors and shapes darted here and there, playing at their games.</p><p>\u201cIt was still and quiet \u2018way down where I lived, for even if the ocean roared and pounded itself into an angry mass of tumbling waves up above, this never disturbed the calm waters down where I lived.</p><p>\u201cMany times, little fishes or other tiny sea people came and hid within my pretty house when they were being pursued by larger sea creatures. And it always made me very happy to give them this protection.</p><p>\u201cThey would stay inside until I whispered that the larger creature had gone, then they would leave me and return to their play.</p><p>\u201cPretty little sea horses with slender, curving bodies often went sailing above me, or would come to rest upon my back. It was nice to lie and watch the tiny things curl their little tails about the sea weed and talk together, for the sea horses like one another and are gentle and kind to each other, sharing their food happily and smoothing their little ones with their cunning noses.</p><p>\u201cBut one day a diver leaped over the side of a boat and came swimming head-first down, down to where I lay. My! How the tiny sea creatures scurried to hide from him. He took me within his hand and, giving his feet a thump upon the yellow sand, rose with me to the surface.</p><p>\u201cHe poured the water from me, and out came all the little creatures who had been hiding there!\u201d</p><p>Raggedy Andy wiggled upon the floor, he was so interested.</p><p>\u201cDid the tiny creatures get back into the water safely?\u201d he asked the beautiful shell.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d the shell whispered in reply. \u201cThe man held me over the side of the boat, so the tiny creatures went safely back into the water!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so glad!\u201d Raggedy Andy said, with a sigh of relief. \u201cHe must have been a kindly man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed!\u201d the beautiful shell replied. \u201cSo I was placed along with a lot of other shells in the bottom of the\u00a0boat and every once in a while another shell was placed amongst us. We whispered together and wondered where we were going. We were finally sold to different people and I have been at Gran\u2019ma\u2019s house for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lived there when Gran\u2019ma was a little girl, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Raggedy Ann asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied the shell, \u201cI have lived there ever since Gran\u2019ma was a little girl. She often used to play with me and listen to me sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaggedy Ann can play \u2018Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater\u2019 on the piano, with one hand,\u201d said Uncle Clem, \u201cbut none of us can sing. Will you sing for us?\u201d he asked the shell.</p><p>\u201cI sing all the time,\u201d the shell replied, \u201cfor I cannot help singing, but my singing is a secret and so is very soft and low. Put your head close to the opening in my shell and listen!\u201d</p><p>The dolls took turns doing this, and heard the shell sing softly and very sweetly.</p><p>\u201cHow strange and far away it sounds!\u201d exclaimed the French doll. \u201cLike fairies singing in the distance! The shell must be singing the songs of the mermaids and the water-fairies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is queer that anything so rough on the outside could be so pretty within!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cIt must be a great pleasure to be able to sing so sweetly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed it is,\u201d replied the beautiful shell, \u201cand I get a great happiness from singing all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will bring lots of pleasure to us, by being so happy!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cFor although you may not enter into our games, we will always know that you are happily singing, and that will make us all happy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you the secret of my singing,\u201d said the shell. \u201cWhen anyone puts his ear to me and listens, he hears the reflection of his own heart\u2019s music, singing; so, you see, while I say that I am singing all the time, in reality I sing only when someone full of happiness hears his own singing as if it were mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unselfish you are to say this!\u201d said Raggedy Andy. \u201cNow we are ever so much more glad to have you with us. Aren\u2019t we?\u201d he asked, turning to the rest of the dolls.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed!\u201d came the answer from all the dolls, even the tiny penny dolls.</p><p>\u201cThat is why the shell is so beautiful inside!\u201d said Raggedy Ann. \u201cThose who are unselfish may wear rough clothes, but inside they are always beautiful, just like the shell, and reflect to others the happiness and sunny music within their hearts!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/illus-095.jpg'></img>"}
