Toto was Dorothy\u2019s small black dog, with fuzzy, curly hair and bright black eyes. Together, when they tired of the grandeur of the Emerald City of Oz, they would wander out into the country and all through the land,peering into queer nooks and corners and having a good time in their own simple way. There was a little Wizard living in Oz who was a faithful friend of Dorothy and did not approve of her traveling alone in this way, but the girl always laughed at the little man\u2019s fears for her and said she was not afraid of anything that might happen.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image12.jpg'></img><p>One day while on such a journey, Dorothy and Toto found themselves among the wild wooded hills at the southeast of Oz\u2014a place usually avoided by travelers because so many magical things abounded there. And, as they entered a forest path, the little girl noticed a sign tacked to a tree, which said: \u201cLook out for Crinklink.\u201d</p><p>Toto could not talk, as many of the animals of Oz can, for he was just a common Kansas dog; but he looked at the sign so seriously that Dorothy almost believed he could read it, and she knew quite well that Toto understood every word she said to him.</p><p>\u201cNever mind Crinklink,\u201d said she. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything in Oz will try to hurt us, Toto, and if I get into trouble you must take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBow-wow!\u201d said Toto, and Dorothy knew that meant a promise.</p><p>The path was narrow and wound here and there between the trees, but they could not lose their way, because thick vines and creepers shut them in on both sides. They had walked a long time when, suddenly turning a curve of the pathway, they came upon a lake of black water, so big and so deep that they were forced to stop.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image13.jpg'></img><p>\u201cWell, Toto,\u201d said Dorothy, looking at the lake, \u201cwe must turn back, I guess, for there is neither a bridge nor a boat to take us across the black water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the ferryman, though,\u201d cried a tiny voice beside them, and the girl gave a start and looked down at her feet, where a man no taller than three inches sat at the edge of the path with his legs dangling over the lake.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d said Dorothy; \u201cI didn\u2019t see you before.\u201d</p><p>Toto growled fiercely and made his ears stand up straight, but the little man did not seem in the least afraid of the dog. He merely repeated: \u201cI\u2019m the ferryman, and it\u2019s my business to carry people across the lake.\u201d</p><p>Dorothy couldn\u2019t help feeling surprised, for she could have picked the little man up with one hand, and the lake was big and broad. Looking at the ferryman more closely she saw that he had small eyes, a big nose, and a sharp chin. His hair was blue and his clothes scarlet, and Dorothy noticed that every button on his jacket was the head of some animal. The top button was a bear\u2019s head and the next button a wolf\u2019s head; the next was a cat\u2019s head and the next a weasel\u2019s head, while the last button of all was the head of a field-mouse. When Dorothy looked into the eyes of these animals\u2019 heads, they all nodded and said in a chorus: \u201cDon\u2019t believe all you hear, little girl!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image14.jpg'></img><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d said the small ferryman, slapping each button head in turn, but not hard enough to hurt them. Then he turned to Dorothy and asked: \u201cDo you wish to cross over the lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019d like to,\u201d she answered, hesitating; \u201cbut I can\u2019t see how you will manage to carry us, without any boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t see, you mustn\u2019t see,\u201d he answered with a laugh. \u201cAll you need do is shut your eyes, say the word, and\u2014over you go!\u201d</p><p>Dorothy wanted to get across, in order that she might continue her journey.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, closing her eyes; \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Instantly she was seized in a pair of strong arms\u2014arms so big and powerful that she was startled and cried out in fear.</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d roared a great voice, and the girl opened her eyes to find that the tiny man had suddenly grown to a giant and was holding both her and Toto in a tight embrace while in one step he spanned the lake and reached the other shore.</p><p>Dorothy became frightened, then, especially as the giant did not stop but continued tramping in great steps over the wooded hills, crushing bushes and trees beneath his broad feet. She struggled in vain to free herself, while Toto whined and trembled beside her, for the little dog was frightened, too.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d screamed the girl. \u201cLet me down!\u201d But the giant paid no attention. \u201cWho are you, and where are you taking me?\u201d she continued; but the giant said not a word. Close to Dorothy\u2019s ear, however, a voice answered her, saying: \u201cThis is the terrible Crinklink, and he has you in his power.\u201d</p><p>Dorothy managed to twist her head around and found it was the second button on the jacket\u2014the wolf\u2019s head\u2014which had spoken to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat will Crinklink do with me?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image15.jpg'></img><p>\u201cNo one knows. You must wait and see,\u201d replied the wolf.</p><p>\u201cSome of his captives he whips,\u201d squeaked the weasel\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSome he transforms into bugs and other things,\u201d growled the bear\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSome he enchants, so that they become doorknobs,\u201d sighed the cat\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSome he makes his slaves\u2014even as we are\u2014and that is the most dreadful fate of all,\u201d added the field-mouse. \u201cAs long as Crinklink exists we shall remain buttons, but as there are no more buttonholes on his jacket he will probably make you a slave.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image16.jpg'></img><p>Dorothy began to wish she had not met Crinklink. Meantime, the giant took such big steps that he soon reached the heart of the hills, where, perched upon the highest peak, stood a log castle. Before this castle he paused to set down Dorothy and Toto, for Crinklink was at present far too large to enter his own doorway. So he made himself grow smaller, until he was about the size of an ordinary man. Then he said to Dorothy, in stern, commanding tones:</p><p>\u201cEnter, girl!\u201d</p><p>Dorothy obeyed and entered the castle, with Toto at her heels. She found the place to be merely one big room. There was a table and chair of ordinary size near the center, and at one side a wee bed that seemed scarcely big enough for a doll. Everywhere else were dishes\u2014dishes\u2014dishes! They were all soiled, and were piled upon the floor, in all the corners and upon every shelf. Evidently Crinklink had not washed a dish for years, but had cast them aside as he used them.</p><p>Dorothy\u2019s captor sat down in the chair and frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cYou are young and strong, and will make a good dishwasher,\u201d said he.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean me to wash all those dishes?\u201d she asked, feeling both indignant and fearful, for such a task would take weeks to accomplish.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I mean,\u201d he retorted. \u201cI need clean dishes, for all I have are soiled, and you\u2019re going to make \u2019em clean or get trounced. So get to work and be careful not to break anything. If you smash a dish, the penalty is one lash from my dreadful cat-o\u2019-nine-tails for every piece the dish breaks into,\u201d and here Crinklink displayed a terrible whip that made the little girl shudder.</p><p>Dorothy knew how to wash dishes, but she remembered that often she carelessly broke one. In this case, however, a good deal depended on being careful, so she handled the dishes very cautiously.</p><p>While she worked, Toto sat by the hearth and growled low at Crinklink, and Crinklink sat in his chair and growled at Dorothy because she moved so slowly. He expected her to break a dish any minute, but as the hours passed away and this did not happen Crinklink began to grow sleepy. It was tiresome watching the girl wash dishes and often he glanced longingly at the tiny bed. Now he began to yawn, and he yawned and yawned until finally he said:</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image17.jpg'></img><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap. But the buttons on my jacket will be wide awake and whenever you break a dish the crash will waken me. As I\u2019m rather sleepy I hope you won\u2019t interrupt my nap by breaking anything for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Then Crinklink made himself grow smaller and smaller until he was three inches high and of a size to fit the tiny bed. At once he lay down and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Dorothy came close to the buttons and whispered: \u201cWould you really warn Crinklink if I tried to\u00a0 escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape,\u201d growled the bear. \u201cCrinklink would become a giant, and soon overtake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you might kill him while he sleeps,\u201d suggested the cat, in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d cried Dorothy, drawing back; \u201cI couldn\u2019t poss\u2019bly kill anything\u2014even to save my life.\u201d</p><p>But Toto had heard this conversation and was not so particular about killing monsters. Also the little dog knew he must try to save his mistress. In an instant he sprang upon the wee bed and was about to seize the sleeping Crinklink in his jaws when Dorothy heard a loud crash and a heap of dishes fell from the table to the floor. Then the girl saw Toto and the little man rolling on the floor together, like a fuzzy ball, and when the ball stopped rolling, behold! there was Toto wagging his tail joyfully and there sat the little Wizard of Oz, laughing merrily at the expression of surprise on Dorothy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear, it\u2019s me,\u201d said he, \u201cand I\u2019ve been playing tricks on you\u2014for your own good. I wanted to prove to you that it is really dangerous for a little girl to wander alone in a fairy country; so I took the form of Crinklink to teach you a lesson. There isn\u2019t any Crinklink, to be sure; but if there had been you\u2019d be severely whipped for breaking all those dishes.\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/image18.jpg'></img><p>The Wizard now rose, took off the coat with the button heads, and spread it on the floor, wrong side up. At once there crept from beneath it a bear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all\u00a0 rushed from the room and escaped into the mountains.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Toto,\u201d said Dorothy; \u201clet\u2019s go back to the Emerald City. You\u2019ve given me a good scare, Wizard,\u201d she added, with dignity, \u201cand p\u2019raps I\u2019ll forgive you, by\u2019n\u2019by; but just now I\u2019m mad to think how easily you fooled me.\u201d</p>"}
