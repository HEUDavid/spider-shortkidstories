The explosion caused chemicals to rise into the sky and land on the three pigs. The pigs were covered with green slime\u2014boy it looked disgusting. This caused them to start running in circles, making them dizzy, and they soon collapsed on top of each other and could not get up.</p><p>Meanwhile, their friend, Hippopatanumus, just happened to be taking his daily jog. He noticed the three piglets and came to save them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning piglets,\u201d he said, and as he saw that the pigs looked a bit hurt, he helped them up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. He couldn\u2019t help laughing because they looked ridiculously funny on top of each other. Hippopatanumus helped each of them to get back on their four little pig feet.</p><p>That night, the chemicals on the pigs started to work on their skin, and there was a strong smell of bacon all around. The next day, to their amazement, the piglets woke up with bacon wings on their backs.</p><p>Now next door to the pigs lived the Big Bad Wolf. He was driven crazy by the delicious smell of bacon. He knocked on their door and asked if he could have some. The piglets were frightened and started running around in circles. Before they knew what was happening, they found themselves flying\u00a0straight out of the window and up into the air. As the wolf knocked and knocked, no one answered. Finally he lost patience and knocked the door down just in time to see the three pigs\u00a0disappearing out the window.</p><p>\u201cAh man, they\u2019re gone!\u201d he cried. The wolf left with a frown on his face.</p><p>After some wobbles, finally the pigs found they could fly. They did not make it far though, as they needed more practice. They landed in mud, and they all freaked out and asked each other what had happened. They just stood there with confused faces. Little Piggy was very excited to have wings. His dream had always been to one day fly high into the sky.</p><p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m too heavy to fly!\u201d said Fatty Pig. Fatty Pig was depressed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sleepy Pig was trying to fly, but he was too tired. All he wanted to do was to take a long nap.</p><p>\u201cWe need to practice,\u201d said the Little Piggy.</p><p>The three piglets went to the top of the mountain. To get a head start, they ran to the end of the cliff and started flapping their bacon wings. Then, as soon as they got close to the cliff, they jumped into the air and up and away, the piglets were flying! These pigs were all brown \u2013 due to the chemical reaction, they looked like delicious apple smoked crispy bacon. It also looked like there was steam coming off the pigs\u2014 but oh no, that wasn\u2019t steam, it was the pigs throwing farts in the sky, powering them forward with great thrusts.</p><p>\u201cOh look, Mama Pig is out there working on her garden,\u201d said Little Pig said to his older brother,</p><p>From above, she looked as tiny as an ant. Well, a fat ant. They flew by her, causing her to lose control of her balance, and as she fell off the steps she was on and ended up rolling all around in the mud.</p><p>\u201cLook, our friend Hippopatanumus!\u201d one of them cried. The three flying piglets flew to their friend and gave him a fright as they landed in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHey Hippopatanumus! How are you?\u201d they all said to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am doing great. Nice wings you got there piglets,\u201d replied Hippopatanumus.</p><p>\u201cThank you hippo,\u201d said the piglets. \u201cBut what are you up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell not much. As you can see, I\u2019m taking a mud bath here.\u201d</p><p>The pigs decided to join their friend in a mud bath party.</p><p>After they finished taking their mud bath, they said goodbye and flew away. Later, however, they flew back to their friend and asked him a question.</p><p>\u201cWas\u00a0your dream to fly one day by any chance? Can we carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a splendid idea,\u201d replied Hippopatanumus.</p><p>The three pigs carried the huge hippopotamus; they only flew for one mile out and one mile back to bring him back home.</p><p>\u201cOh boy he was heavy!\u201d they all said to each other once they released him. The Big Bad Wolf decided to sneak by, but the pigs saw him and flew away. Once more the wolf walked away with a frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting very exhausted here,\u201d said Fatty Pig.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a break,\u201d replied Little Pig.</p><p>\u201cWhat a wonderful idea guys,\u201d added Sleepy Pig.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a break at the beach,\u201d suggested Fatty pig,</p><p>The other pigs thought this would be a splendid idea. When they flew to the beach, which was called Piggy State Park, the three pigs were the only ones with wings. Every pig asked them where they had gotten their wings.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was an accident,\u201d they said.</p><p>The other pigs made fun of them, saying, \u201cYou guys look ludicrous!\u201d</p><p>The Big Bad Wolf just happened to appear on the beach.</p><p>\u201cOh no the wolf is here!\u201d they chimed in unison.</p><p>All the pigs started running and hiding from the Big Bad Wolf. The wolf was only there for the delicious bacon-smelling piglets, but they had wings so they escaped. When the wolf finally turned around, he noticed that all the pigs were gone. For a third time, he walked away with a frown on his face .</p><p>As the pigs flew back home, they realized they didn\u2019t care what people (or pigs) said about them. At the end of the day, you are your own person (or pig) and as long as you are happy, why should you let other pigs (or people) put you down? Haters will always hate. All that matters is that you are always beautiful in the inside and the outside; you are just a whole different pig (or person) from the rest of them. There is nothing wrong with being different because everybody (or every pig) is different in every way possible.</p><p>When the pigs arrived at their home, the Big Bad Wolf was standing there, so they flew away and carried their mother to another country called Utopia, where everybody is treated with kindness and every single pig cares about you even if they are crazy, ugly, beautiful, or look different from the others. The Big Bad Wolf never did get a chance to eat their wings. He sat down, with that frown on his face again, one last time.</p>"}
