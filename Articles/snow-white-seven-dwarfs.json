Then she gazed thoughtfully down on the red drops which sprinkled the white snow and said, \u201cif only my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as the blood, and as black as the ebony window-frame!\u201d And so the little girl grew up; her skin was a white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snow-White.</p><p>But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who was very beautiful, but so proud that she could not bear to think that any one could be more beautiful than her. She had a magical looking-glass, to which she used to go and gaze upon herself in it, and say\u2014</p><blockquote>\u201cTell me, glass, tell me true!<br/> Of all the ladies in the land,<br/> Who is fairest? tell me who?\u201d</blockquote><p>And the glass answered, \u201cYou, Queen, are the fairest in the land\u201d But Snow-White grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old, she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered queen, when she went to consult it as usual\u2014</p><blockquote>\u201cYou, Queen, may beauteous be,<br/> But Snow-White is\u00a0far lovelier than three\u201d</blockquote><p>When the queen heard this she turned pale with rage and envy; and calling to one of her servants said, \u201cTake Snow-White away into the wide wood, that I may never see her more.\u201d Then the servant led the little girl away; but his heart melted when she begged him to spare her life, and he said, \u201cI will not hurt you, pretty child.\u201d So he left her there alone; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her to pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her, but leave her to her fate.</p><p>Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared around, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a little cottage, and went in there to rest, for her weary feet would carry her no further.</p><p>Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates with seven little loaves and seven little glasses with wine in them; and knives and forks laid in order, and by the wall stood seven little beds.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/051.png'></img><p>Then, as she was exceedingly hungry, she picked a little piece off each loaf, and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; and one was too long, and another was too short, till, at last, the seventh suited her; and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.</p><p>In time, in came the masters of the cottage, who were seven little dwarfs that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched about for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw directly that all was not right. The first said, \u201cWho has been sitting on my stool?\u201d The second, \u201cWho has been eating off my plate?\u201d The third, \u201cWho has been picking at my bread?\u201d The fourth, \u201cWho has been meddling with my spoon?\u201d The fifth, \u201cWho has been handling my fork?\u201d The sixth, \u201cWho has been cutting with my knife?\u201d The seventh, \u201cWho has been drinking my wine?\u201d Then the first looked around and said, \u201cWho has been lying on my bed?\u201d</p><p>And the rest came running to him, and every one cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snow-White, and called upon his brothers to come and look at her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment, and brought their lamps and gazing upon her, they said, \u201cGood heavens! what a lovely child she is!\u201d And they were delighted to see her, and took care not to waken her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.</p><p>In the morning Snow-White told them all her story, and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash, and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her.</p><p>Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home; and they warned her, saying, \u201cThe queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.\u201d But the queen, now that she thought Snow-White was dead, believed that she was certainly the handsomest lady in the land; so she went to her glass and said\u2014</p><blockquote>\u201cTell me, glass, tell me true!<br/> Of all the ladies in the land,<br/> Who is fairest? tell me who?\u201d</blockquote><p>And the glass answered\u2014</p><blockquote>\u201cYou, Queen, you are fairest in all this land;<br/> But over the Hills, in the greenwood shade,<br/> Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,<br/> There Snow-White is hiding;<br/> and she Is lovelier far, O Queen, than you.\u201d</blockquote><p>Then the queen was very much alarmed; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and she was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And as she could not bear to think that any one lived who was more beautiful than she was, she disguised herself as an old pedlar woman and went her way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt.</p><p>She knocked at the door and cried, \u201cFine wares to sell!\u201d Snow-White looked out of the window, and said, \u201cGood day, good woman; what have you to sell?\u201d \u201cGood wares, fine wares,\u201d replied she; \u201claces and bobbins of all colors.\u201d \u201cI will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of a body,\u201d thought Snow-White; so she ran down, and unbolted the door. \u201cBless me!\u201d said the woman, \u201chow badly your clothes are laced. Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.\u201d</p><p>Snow-White did not dream of any mischief; so she stood up before the old woman who set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tightly that Snow-White lost her breath, and fell down as if she were dead. \u201cThere\u2019s an end of all your beauty,\u201d said the spiteful queen, and went away home.</p><p>In the evening the seven dwarfs returned; and I need not say how sad they were to see their faithful Snow-White stretched upon the ground motionless, as if she were quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what was the matter, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and soon came to herself again.</p><p>Then they said, \u201cThe old woman was the queen; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.\u201d When the queen got home, she went to her glass, and spoke to it, but to her surprise it replied in the same words as before.</p><p>Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and hatred to hear that Snow-White still lived; and she dressed herself up again in a disguise, but very different from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.</p><p>When she reached the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, \u201cFine wares to sell!\u201d but Snow-White said, \u201cI dare not let any one in.\u201d Then the queen said, \u201cOnly look at my beautiful combs;\u201d and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty that the little girl took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.</p><p>\u201cThere you may lie,\u201d said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs returned very early that evening; and when they saw Snow-White lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away, she recovered, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to any one.</p><p>Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and trembled with rage when she received exactly the same answer as before; and she said, \u201cSnow-White shall die, if it costs me my life.\u201d So she went secretly into a chamber, and prepared a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whosoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant\u2019s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-White put her head out of the window, and said, \u201cI dare not let any one in, for the dwarfs have told me not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you please,\u201d said the old woman, \u201cbut at any rate take this pretty apple; I will make you a present of it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Snow-White, \u201cI dare not take it.\u201d \u201cYou silly girl!\u201d answered the other, \u201cwhat are you afraid of? do you think it is poisoned? Come! Eat one part, and I will eat the other.\u201d Now the apple was so prepared that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-White was very much tempted to taste, for the apple looked exceedingly nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground.</p><p>\u201cThis time nothing will save you,\u201d said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said\u2014\u201dYou, Queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\u201d And then her jealous heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. When evening came, and the dwarfs returned home, they found Snow-White lying on the ground; no breath passed her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead.</p><p>They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain. So they laid her down upon a stand, and all seven watched and cried for her for three whole days; and then they proposed to bury her; but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, \u201cWe will never bury her in the cold ground.\u201d And they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king\u2019s daughter. Then the coffin was placed upon the hill, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came, too, and cried for Snow-White. First of all came an owl, and then a raven, but at last came a dove.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/054.png'></img><p>And so Snow-White lay there for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs\u2019 house; and he saw Snow-White and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly begged them to let him take her away; but they said, \u201cWe will not part with her for all the gold in the world.\u201d At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and exclaimed, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>And the prince answered, \u201cYou are safe with me.\u201d Then he told her all that had happened, and said, \u201cI love you better than all the world; come with me to my father\u2019s palace, and you shall be my wife.\u201d Snow-White agreed, and went home with the prince; and everything was prepared with great pomp and splendor for their wedding.</p><p>To the feast was invited, among the rest, Snow-White\u2019s old enemy, the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine, rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said,</p><blockquote>\u201cTell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest? tell me who?\u201d</blockquote><p>And the glass answered,</p><blockquote>\u201cYou, are the loveliest <i>here</i>, that can be seen;<br/> But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\u201d</blockquote><p>When she heard this, the queen started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she arrived, and saw that it was no other than Snow-White, whom she thought had been dead a long while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died; but Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land, many, many years.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/057.png'></img>"}
