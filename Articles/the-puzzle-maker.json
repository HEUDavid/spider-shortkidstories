Karen didn\u2019t let a thing pass unseen on the long walk to school\u2013not the neighborhood cats grown fat from winter mice, nor the splashy colors of flowers in the once drab and icy pots and planters, nor the trees turned shady again. She skipped over dandelions wiggling free from cracks in the pavement and pricked her ears at crickets chirping in the hedges and buzzing bumblebees busy relearning how to make honey.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her first time walking the maze of narrow streets, but it was her first time as a third-grader.</p><p>In Karen\u2019s town the new school year began in April\u2013that month where the ground is always wet from morning showers and when everyone carries with them an umbrella, knowing if it\u2019s not raining now it will be on the way home.</p><p>Karen had forgotten her umbrella this morning. It was easy to overlook things in the rush and excitement of the first day. Did she remember her name tag? There it was, pinned on her shirt. And her thermos of tea? Strapped to the outside of her backpack with her good luck charms. There were also her school shoes and all her new books. She had enough to carry without the umbrella.</p><p>At the corner she sniffed fresh-cut grass and ashy incense in the air. From between the houses she could see the cemetery on the hill, bright under the sun yet darkened by gray slabs of stone. She sped up past the small open gate. There\u2019s nothing wrong with taking the long way around, she thought.</p><p>A half an hour later she spotted all her teachers from last year and a few new ones standing in a line at the school entrance. \u201cGood morning,\u201d they greeted the children. \u201cFine weather so far,\u201d they said to neighbors passing by.</p><p>Karen waved at her friends as they changed into their school shoes in the front hallway. They waved back and called out, \u201cHurry up, Karen!\u201d But before going through the gate Karen\u2019s keen eyes spied a shimmer of light on the side of the road. It was a coin with the number 1 etched in the middle. She stopped and looked around at the other kids. Either they had all missed it or passed it up. I guess not many people take the time to pick up such a small amount of money, she thought. But I do! She gave the coin a quick polish on her denim skirt and dropped it in her pocket. She would add it to her savings.</p><p>Karen wasn\u2019t hoping to buy anything in particular, so it was less of a savings and more of a collection. She didn\u2019t have a piggy bank, besides. But she had stacks and stacks of the coins hidden away. She was proud of her hiding spot. What better place than the very top of the bookshelf where no one ever puts any books? She had to use the piano bench to reach, and so it never occurred to her that anyone else, like her parents, knew the coins were there.</p><p>Before the bell rang she stepped into her new classroom where all the same kids from the year before were busy doing all the same things they always did. The girls read romance comics and drew hearts or ice cream cones or baby chicks or stars (their personal symbols) next to their names on their notebooks. The boys played tag between the desks and went to feed the class beetle and the goldfish.</p><p>The first day was her favorite. Besides being able to see all her friends again, there were orientations, and teachers talked about spring break, and there was never any homework. The day flew by.</p><p>At the end of sixth period everyone raced to change back into their dirty sneakers and pull their umbrellas from the rack. Sometime after recess, huge gray pillows of rainclouds had blown in overhead, and it began to sprinkle.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to borrow an umbrella?\u201d Karen\u2019s teacher asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The teacher held out her palm and caught a couple of raindrops. \u201cI don\u2019t want you coming in with a cold tomorrow. I\u2019d feel better if you used one of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a drizzle. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but be careful,\u201d said the teacher with a smile, because she also knew it was fun sometimes to play in the rain.</p><p>Karen smiled back and was on her way.</p><p>Down the street she listened to the plip-plop of rain on the other kids\u2019 umbrellas. She watched the little drops scatter here and there on the road, soaking into the concrete like a field of polka dots.</p><p>When everyone had turned down different paths, and Karen had turned down hers, she held out her arms and twirled on her toes. The rain felt cool on her skin. Again and again she looked up to the sky, so low she might have touched it if she jumped.</p><p>She wiped her face on her arm and glanced at the hill where the trees shook in the wind and the leaves danced. The grass between the gravestones rolled in waves. Then, in a flash and a boom, thunder cracked the clouds like eggshells, and out came the downpour.</p><p>Karen\u2019s heart took a leap. It was as if she\u2019d just clanked her way up the first rise of a roller coaster and was all at once free-falling down the other side.</p><p>Before she knew it she was soaked to the bone and still a long way from home. With a big gulp she ran between the houses to a small swinging gate and started up the lonely cemetery trail.</p><p>The straps on her backpack clapped up and down, and the tin pen case inside rattled like bones. She ran with her eyes clenched shut, splashed through puddles, and squeaked her shoes over wet grass. Another thunderbolt shook the sky and pulled open her eyes. She was surrounded by slabs of dark granite. There were so many tall gravestones written up and down with names and words that she couldn\u2019t read. Some were polished and new and glistened under the rainwater. Others were ancient and worn down round as river stones.</p><p>The wind howled through the trees, and rain crackled in the leaves as she headed down the other side of the hill. She burst out of the gate and stopped to catch her breath. That wasn\u2019t so scary! she thought once she\u2019d made it through. And she smiled because she knew she could take the short cut any time she wanted now.</p><p>Karen didn\u2019t recognize exactly where she was, but she saw her neighbor\u2019s cat and knew her house was nearby if she took the right path. As she started down the street her eyes landed on a small house with a storefront in the first floor. The sign above the door read:</p><p>KEN\u2019S WOODEN PUZZLES</p><p>There was a dry patch of street under the awning. She stood there with her hands on the glass, staring in at the wonderful displays of hand-painted, hand-carved standing puzzles.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen anything like them and was surprised to find a place like this so close to her house. The puzzles were made of thick, wooden jigsaw pieces stacked up one upon the other. Painted on the face of each piece was a person or part of a picture.</p><p>On the top shelf she saw designs of kids on Field Day. They made human pyramids, played tug-of-war, walked blindfolded and carrying sticks to hit a giant watermelon as if it were a pi\u00f1ata, jumped rope ten people at a time, or stood behind snow cone stands. On the next shelf were long locomotives, old biplanes with three or four layers of striped wings, and hot air balloons drifting over hills and mountains. Then on the lowest shelf there were farm animals and safari animals and mythical dragons, all stretching out into the air yet held up by their own pieces.</p><p>But it was on the inside of the store that she spotted the neatest puzzle of all. It was a picture of a girl dressed up for a festival, carrying a sparkler in one hand and a skewer of pink, white, and green sweet dumplings in the other.</p><p>Karen slowly opened the door and entered the shop. There was a tinkling of a bell, and a man walked in from the back room. He took off his work gloves, brushed the wood shavings from his shirt, and said, \u201cHi, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Karen said back.</p><p>\u201cDo you like puzzles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve never seen puzzles like this before. I mean, I\u2019ve seen 3D puzzles, but not quite like this.\u201d Karen walked around, glancing at the different designs and the price tags. They all looked pretty expensive.</p><p>\u201cEach one is hand-built,\u201d said the man.</p><p>\u201cI bet it takes a long time to make one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure does. The more details, the more time it takes. But, you know, the more time it takes, the better you feel about it when it\u2019s done. My name\u2019s Ken, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren.\u201d She smiled at the man and then walked up to the puzzle that had caught her eye. She saw it was missing a piece. The painted girl was looking up at something, but Karen didn\u2019t know what. There was only an empty space in the sky above her.</p><p>\u201cYou like that one? Want me to wrap it up for you so it doesn\u2019t get wet on the way home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d</p><p>The man leaned forward for a look at the price and mumbled, \u201cHow much is that one, again? 1,000?\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cWell, it is missing a piece. What do you say we make it 700? No, 600? I\u2019ll even hold it for you if you wanna come back later with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201c600?\u201d Karen thought about her savings. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d she said, and burst out into the rain. She raced down the street and around the bend and past the hedges until she recognized some of the houses. She was home in no time.</p><p>She flung open the door, kicked off her shoes, and ran into the living room. Her mother called down from upstairs, \u201cHow was the first day of school, deary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll be back!\u201d</p><p>Leaving wet sock-prints on the piano bench and all the way back down the hall, Karen landed in her shoes and was fast on her way back to the wooden puzzle shop. This time she remembered her umbrella but couldn\u2019t grab it with her hands so full.</p><p>Ken was still hanging around the front of the shop when Karen came back in and dropped a shirt-tail full of paper-thin coins down on the glass counter.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick,\u201d the shop owner said. But when he saw the coins he folded his arms and titled his head. \u201cDon\u2019t think I can lower the price any more. And that\u2019s the cheapest puzzle I got. Hmmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Lemme count it all up first!\u201d Karen said.</p><p>\u201cGuess it won\u2019t hurt. You never know, huh.\u201d And bit by bit, four index fingers counted out the small coins.</p><p>A few minutes later the man looked up and said, \u201cI counted 282.\u201d</p><p>Karen finished pushing the rest of the coins into her pile and said, \u201c317. That\u2019s\u2026599.\u201d When she looked up Ken was biting his lip, and she was sure he was about to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>Then she remembered! She reached way down into her pocket and pulled up the last coin\u2013the one she\u2019d found earlier. And how it sparkled! \u201c600!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how \u2018bout that!\u201d</p><p>Karen carried the puzzle home. When she\u2019d changed out of her wet clothes and finished dinner, she laid all the pieces out on the living room rug. She stacked up the blocks and stared at the hole in the center of the puzzle. Just what was that little girl looking at?</p><p>\u201cIt could be anything,\u201d she thought aloud. Then she remembered the scraps of wood her dad kept in the garage and the set of paints up in her room. \u201cI could make anything!\u201d And Karen The Puzzle Maker smiled a big smile and shouted, \u201cI know what it is!\u201d</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/The-Puzzle-Maker-Illustration-opt.jpg'></img><p>THE END  Did you know?</p><p>Karen\u2019s name is actually pronounced k\u00e4r\u0115n, like \u201cCaa-len,\u201d and is written as \u304b\u308c\u3093.</p><p>Ken is short for Kentaro.
