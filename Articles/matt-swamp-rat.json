When he asked his mom this what she had to say: \u201cClean your room and make your bed. Or you will stay inside instead.\u201d</p><p>Matt the swamp rat thought,\u00a0I want to play outside, in his head. Then decided to clean his room and make his bed. Matt the swamp rat was allowed to go out and play. Which he wanted to make a new friend today.</p><p>He knew where he wasn\u2019t allowed to be. SO\u00a0I\u2019d better stay within the area mom set for me. Which was no further than that big old oak tree. Or past the swamp in the woods mom told me.</p><p>Matt the swamp rat moved on down the path at an even pace. That\u2019s when he saw a toad and what a face. Old with wrinkles and sad droopy eyes, whenever he moved he let out these cries:</p><p>\u201cOwie, ouchie, these pains make me grouchy.\u201d Matt the swamp rat said \u201cHey would you like to play? I know you\u2019re old but I was told to respect my elders in this way.\u201d</p><p>Well this surely took the grumpy old toad by surprise. And he didn\u2019t even roll his wrinkled droopy eyes. \u201cThank you young kid for what you did, but I\u2019m too old now to play. And thank you for brightening my day.\u201d</p><p>I have to think ,think, think, How to make more milk for people to drink. So be on your way ok?\u201d Well before Matt the swamp rat left he said \u201cThank you for the milk you make. For it taste great with the cookies mom\u2019s bake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat put\u2019s a smile on my face,\u201d said the cow. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find away to make more milk now.\u201d</p><p>Matt the swamp bunny wait he\u2019s a rat that\u2019s not funny. Went further to see what he could see And that\u2019s when he noticed this monstrous tree.</p><p>It was big around and very tall. Surely had to be the largest tree of them all. It was that big old oak tree which had acorns all around A squirrel was trying to gather them from the ground.</p><p>Would you like to play on this beautiful sunny summer day. No, no, no, I cannot play. I\u2019m storing nuts in this tree. To survive the winter for my family you see.</p><p>So be on your way ok. Matt the swamp rat said well I hope you get as much food as your family needs. Like berries, nuts and even seeds.</p><p>Why thank you young kid and have a good day. Oh and I hope you find the fun you\u2019re looking for today</p><p>Matt the swamp rat, not bunny, He, He,\u00a0that was kind of funny. Well he ran across this bear and asked would you like to play. On this beautiful summer day.</p><p>The bear growls \u201cI\u2019m hungry for honey you see. But it\u2019s in this tree. I try and try to get this delicious golden treat. But now with all my struggles I have to accept defeat.</p><p>\u201cWell sorry Mr. Bear,\u201d Matt the swamp rat said \u201cfor your bad luck. Maybe you can reach in that hole in the tree or are you afraid you\u2019ll get stuck?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d the bear growled, \u201cyou\u2019ll see.\u201d Then reached right into the tree</p><p>Yahoo!! He had howled and when he removed his paw. It was covered in honey they both saw. \u201cThank you thank you my little friend. You are welcome back again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse me I have to chow down. To fatten up for my hibernation underground.\u201d Matt the swamp rat made a lot of people happy today. But didn\u2019t find a friend that wanted to play.</p><p>So he went home and called it a day.</p><p>He told his mom of all the things he had done. That\u2019s when the door bell was rung. It was a new kid Billy Bob who moved next door and wanted to play. \u201cMy name is Matt I\u2019m a swamp rat and I\u2019ll see what my mom has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead son and enjoy the rest of the day. But don\u2019t be late for supper or you\u2019ll be grounded I say.\u201d \u201cThanks mom Matt said happy as could be. I\u2019ll be home for supper you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Matt and Billy Bob became very good friends. That never came to an end.</p>"}
