at the worst times.</p><p>I lost my two front teeth on the morning of my seventh birthday.\u00a0 My mom had baked a special cake shaped like a snowman and all done up in frosty, colored icing.\u00a0 All I could do was look at it.</p><p>A couple years after that it was the chicken pox.\u00a0 Not so bad when you get to miss school, unless it\u2019s only one day and it\u2019s the last day before summer vacation.\u00a0 All I missed out on were water fights in the halls.\u00a0 As if that isn\u2019t bad enough, I had to spend half my summer shut inside the house too.</p><p>That\u2019s the kind of stuff that could drive a kid bonkers, you know.</p><p>From atop my comforter I looked up at the hotrod calendar on my wall then down at my leg wrapped tight in an itchy, white cast.\u00a0 The first day of Spring Break.\u00a0 And me with a broken leg.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Spring-Break-Image-1-1024x768.png'></img><p>Here we go again.\u00a0 Bonkers!</p><p>Propped up on my bed, the cast looked like some huge, stringy cocoon about to sprout Mothra.\u00a0 If it did, that would\u2019ve been a lot cooler than lying on my back watching TV all day.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t help that I could hear all my friends down at the baseball field slugging fly balls into the trees and popping fouls into neighbors\u2019 yards.\u00a0 They were gearing up for the first game of the season, only a couple practices away.</p><p>Ding!\u00a0 There goes another one, I thought.</p><p>Halfway through the Godzilla movie marathon I clicked off the tube and tossed the remote into the hamper with the dirty clothes.\u00a0 \u201cYes!\u00a0 2 points!\u201d\u00a0 My excitement fizzled away though when I realized that was another thing I was missing out on.\u00a0 Basketball.</p><p>Around noon my dad brought up a plate of hotdogs, a bag of chips, and a tall glass of grape juice.\u00a0 \u201cHow you doing, champ?\u201d\u00a0 He set the tray on the side table and planted himself on the foot of my bed.\u00a0 \u201cI remember when I got a broken leg.\u00a0 No fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone come to sign your cast?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u00a0 Everyone in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think people will come to sign my cast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come.\u00a0 And when it\u2019s time to get that thing off, why, it\u2019ll be so covered in signatures you won\u2019t be able to see a speck of white anywhere, even with a microscope.\u201d\u00a0 There was a smile playing in his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWho knows, you might not even want to take it off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cMaybe I could hang it on my wall, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn even better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if they don\u2019t come?\u00a0 They\u2019re all too busy playing ball without me.\u201d</p><p>Just then a roaring cheer broke out amongst the boys down at the field.\u00a0 \u201cPickle!\u00a0 Pickle!\u00a0 Get him!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my head and let out a sigh.\u00a0 \u201cPickle?\u00a0 That hardly ever happens!\u00a0 And I\u2019m missing it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a pickle right there, champ.\u201d\u00a0 My dad laughed, and I tried to cover my smile with a pout.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheer up.\u00a0 Before you know it your leg\u2019ll be as good as new.\u00a0 Better even.\u00a0 Bet after it heals you\u2019ll be able to run so fast people will give you the nickname \u2018House Burglar.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018House Burglar\u2019?\u00a0 Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll be able to steal home easier than chewing gum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteal home?\u00a0 Yeah, right!\u00a0 \u2018Sides, spring break\u2019ll be long gone by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as that time you lost your baby teeth on your birthday and had to eat applesauce the whole week and through Christmas.\u00a0 Or that summer you got the chicken pox.\u00a0 Remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>My dad slapped his hands on his knees and walked across the room.\u00a0 He pulled a big, permanent marker from the desk drawer and came over to sign my cast.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll give it the old doctor signature so your friends won\u2019t be able to tell it was your dad.\u201d\u00a0 He raised the marker in a swish and a swoop and said, \u201cThere!\u00a0 The first of many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t mind if they know.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wink and headed back downstairs.</p><img

playing ball across the street.\u00a0 There had to be something I could do up here, I thought, to keep myself busy, to keep the bonkers away.\u00a0 I shuffled through the stacks of books at my bedside and pulled up an old paper-airplane manual.\u00a0 In no time at all I ripped straight through an entire notebook, cover to cover, and turned my bed into an aircraft carrier.</p><p>With the backscratcher I kept for emergency itches under my cast I was able to pop open the window screen and send one of my constructions out for a test flight.\u00a0 It quickly turned into a game, and the goal was to find the right design and aerodynamics to get as many planes into the sandlot as I could.\u00a0 Maybe someone might notice and come up to see me.</p><p>A bit later, just when I started to think none of my airplanes had made it past the yard, there came the muffled ring of the doorbell.\u00a0 I sat up when I heard a tumbling-thumping of sock-feet in the hallway.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Spring-Break-Image-3-justify-right-768x1024.png'></img><p>My bedroom door burst open and Dustin appeared.\u00a0 He froze, wide-eyed, and whistled like a slide whistle.\u00a0 \u201cMan!\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>Casey popped in behind him.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, your leg looks like one of those rockets they strap to the bottom of the space shuttle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t as bad as it looks,\u201d I said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cSaw your airplanes,\u201d Dustin smiled.\u00a0 \u201cCaught one with my mitt.\u201d</p><p>Casey chuckled.\u00a0 \u201cFigured you had to be bored out of your mind to make that many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u00a0 Was just practicing my pitching arm, you know.\u00a0 So, you guys wanna sign my cast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u00a0 You\u2019re gonna let us sign your cast?\u201d\u00a0 Dustin picked up the marker.</p><p>\u201cI can practice my autograph,\u201d jumped Casey, who was always practicing his autograph.\u00a0 \u201cI gotta perfect it for when I become the best shortstop in the history of the majors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than Barry Larkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u00a0 My autograph could beat Larkin\u2019s any old day of the week!\u201d</p><p>Dustin and I grabbed our stomachs and broke out laughing.\u00a0 Then Dustin said, \u201cHe might be right, though.\u00a0 You seen his trading card collection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery last one signed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u00a0 But if you look close, all the signatures are the same.\u00a0 They all read \u2018Casey Albright!\u2019\u201d</p><p>This time Casey laughed with us.\u00a0 \u201cIt looks more genuine to sign a baseball card than it does to sign your math notebook.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help that they haven\u2019t made any cards with me on them yet.\u201d</p><p>Dustin squiggled in his name on the top of my foot.\u00a0 Casey streaked his across my shin, above my dad\u2019s name.\u00a0 I leaned forward for a closer look.\u00a0 \u201cThanks, guys.\u201d</p><p>Recapping the pen, Casey said, \u201cKeep that thing and you\u2019ll be rich one day.\u201d</p><p>Dustin smiled.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, cause of my name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you guys think you could get ahold of the rest of the gang?\u00a0 Maybe we could even get the whole town to come sign my cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea!\u00a0 You might have to break your other leg, though, just to fit all those names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet we could at least get all the kids from school over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u00a0 Everyone\u2019ll be glad to see that you\u2019re doing alright, too.\u201d</p><p>Dustin and Casey didn\u2019t stay long that night, but I didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0 They came back the next day, and they brought Jimmy and Ralph and Nick too.\u00a0 Then more people came after that.\u00a0 Doug and Julie and Lance and Joseph and Kristen.\u00a0 And still more came, day after day.</p><p>In between visits I thought about when I lost my front teeth.\u00a0 I realized it wasn\u2019t all bad.\u00a0 I was the only kid in the school recital who didn\u2019t have to hide his buck teeth with shoe polish to sing \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth.\u201d\u00a0 And thinking about my summer with the chicken pox I remembered passing the itchy bumps on to Johnny Fairfield when my mom had that pox party.\u00a0 He was the clean-up batter and star player for the little league team across town.\u00a0 If he hadn\u2019t been stuck in the house after I got better we might not have won the Series that year.\u00a0 But who knows?</p><p>All I know is sometimes bad things happen at the best times.</p><p>The last few afternoons of the break everyone came to help me down to the dugout where I could watch some of the practices.\u00a0 It was really cool, too, when they set up a stool behind home plate and let me play catcher a couple times.\u00a0 I had never played catcher before, but I liked it a lot and was pretty good at it too.</p><img src='https://xcx.mdavid.cn/img/Spring-Break-Image-4-1024x768.png'></img><p>By the time school started back up I decided to change positions, and when I asked, they even let me field the first inning of the very first game.\u00a0 They had to substitute me when we went to bat, but catching those strikes was the best feeling ever!\u00a0 I was so excited I stood on my crutches and cheered the team on for the rest of the game.\u00a0 My leg didn\u2019t hurt at all anymore, and my cast no longer looked like a giant moth cocoon or a space shuttle rocket\u2013it looked like a hundred different trading cards, autographed by the best players around:\u00a0 my friends.\u00a0 That was the greatest spring break ever.</p>"}
