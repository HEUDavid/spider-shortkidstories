In spring the forest was a rainbow of new blossoms.\u00a0 Autumn brought a golden sunset of yellow, red, and orange.\u00a0 In the snowy white of winter it became an enchanted forest under the sparkle of the sun and the moon.\u00a0 His favorite part of the forest was the ancient trees, from strong oaks, aspens that sang with the slightest breeze, to sturdy pines.\u00a0 A variety of berry bushes grew every few feet.\u00a0 Velvety green ferns filled the remaining open space.\u00a0 It was so magical you expected to meet fairies and all sorts of fun creatures.\u00a0 But best of all, in this thick forest it was easy to find a den to call home, and one big enough to hold many guests.</p><p>He found many watchers mingled with the ordinary birds and since his den was large enough, they could gather to share fun tales of far-away adventures.\u00a0 Watchers were all different kinds of birds to help them go unnoticed.\u00a0 They liked to roam the earth looking for gifted ones; the ones whose destiny it was to protect and watch over nature.\u00a0 They all had been in Egalliv for a long time though, because it was different;, there were more gifted ones, both young and old than anywhere else on earth.</p><p>Drib first saw Elsa as a small baby in her mother\u2019s arms.\u00a0 She had deep intriguing blue eyes that sparkled with the light and made him feel like he could climb inside and journey to another world.\u00a0 As she grew to a young lass, her fair skin was softened by her beautiful long white hair.\u00a0 Her laughter was contagious \u2013 it floated through the air making even the grumpiest toad happy.\u00a0 When he first saw her his feathers shuddered with excitement.\u00a0 He knew she was special, more gifted than the others and that their destinies were somehow linked together.</p><p>As Elsa got older she sensed she was different from the other children in the village \u2013 a feeling that grew \u2013 a whisper that told her of a mystery that would someday manifest her destiny.\u00a0 She wondered if it was something about her family.\u00a0 But, they were not exceptional \u2013 father was a carpenter, mother a seamstress, and her brother was like every other boy in the village.\u00a0 She was shy, but she had many friends she spent lots of time with.\u00a0 Nothing different that anyone would call special.</p><p>When she turned ten, she was old enough to travel to her grandmother, Nana\u2019s, house alone.\u00a0\u00a0 Mother asked if she wanted to take a fresh batch of cookies to Nana.\u00a0 She was so excited.\u00a0 This meant mother trusted her and it made her feel so grown up.\u00a0 What a grand adventure.\u00a0 She loved Nana, and her house was on the other side of the village in the middle of the forest.\u00a0 She loved being in the forest with all the beautiful flowers, animals, and the arched pathway made by the ancient trees.\u00a0 It was like being in a magical land.\u00a0\u00a0 It was spring and everything would be fresh and new, and she might even see some baby animals along the way which she could feed the crumbs she would tuck in her pockets.\u00a0 After she finished her morning chores, mother loaded her bag and off she went.</p><p>As she entered the forest she heard the lively song of a new bird, one she had never heard before. The music was loud and seemed to be following her.\u00a0 She turned around to see what kind of bird she had discovered, but jumped back with a start because a black bird with a crown of orange feathers was flying straight toward her face.\u00a0 She raised the bag to block her face when she suddenly heard in her mind:</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is Drib, what is yours?\u201d</p><p>I must be imagining things.\u00a0 Did I just hear the bird talking in my mind?\u00a0 What should I do?\u00a0 Am I in a dream?</p><p>\u201cNo dream, and don\u2019t\u2019 be afraid. What is your name?\u201d\u00a0 Drib pleaded.</p><p>\u201cElsa,\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>\u201cGlad to meet you Elsa.\u00a0 By your thoughts, I see that I\u2019m the first watcher you have ever encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is a watcher, how can I hear your thoughts, and how can you read my mind?\u201d Elsa stammered.</p><p>\u201c\u201cWatchers are special birds who can transfer thoughts into the minds of gifted ones.\u00a0 When a gifted one is upset, we can sometimes hear their thoughts.\u00a0 Whole conversations go undetected by the non-gifted ones,\u201d Drib explained.</p><p>Intrigued by his explanation, Elsa wanted to see if it was true.\u00a0 \u201cSo I can send you thoughts, like, I\u2019m not a gifted one; I just have a vivid imagination?</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, \u201cYou ARE a gifted one, though, and have much to learn, so if you don\u2019t mind the company, I\u2019ll sit on your shoulder and explain while we finish the walk to your grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d Drib pleaded.</p><p>Her new acquaintance he seemed harmless and friendly, but she was hoping her insides would stop shaking and her brain would start making sense before they started walking.\u00a0 So, she said, \u201cOk, I guess you can join me, but before we go, I\u2019d like to sit for a while and feed the crumbs I brought to my animal friends.\u201d</p><p>As she on a tree stump, she started humming, and soon birds and animals were frolicking around her.\u00a0 She was easily distracted seeing all the baby rabbits, squirrels and other small animals\u00a0 The animals easily distracted her and her mind and body started to relax, but her peace was quickly interrupted by Drib.</p><p>\u201cHave you never found it interesting that the animals and birds always come close and eat out of your hands?\u201d\u00a0 he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI just thought it was because they were used to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Drib replied, \u201conly gifted ones have the ability to make such good friends of the forest animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was a gifted one?\u201d Elsa asked.</p><p>\u201cI have been watching you since I first saw you as a baby in your mother\u2019s arms.\u00a0 You radiated a strong aura of color.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been silently waiting and watching until your aura was strong enough and the opportunity arose to introduce myself \u2013 and today is my day,\u201d Drib shared.</p><p>While Elsa was feeding the crumbs she brought to her friends, a baby rabbit scampered over and jumped onto her lap. Still confused she asked Drib, \u201cWhat are gifted ones supposed to do with their gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGifted ones,\u201d Drib explained, \u201ctell the watchers what dangers are lurking and what mankind has planned that might endanger nature.\u00a0 For instance, if someone was going to cut down part of the forest, dam up a river, we would need to move our homes, or anything else that might harm us.\u201d</p><p>As Drib spoke, she realized this was her mystery, the thing that made her feel special. She giggled, though, at the thought that a bird was the messenger. Suddenly, she was startled by a rustling in the undergrowth behind her.\u00a0\u00a0 She jumped to her feet, scaring off her little friends and Drib, who flew up to the nearest branch.\u00a0 As she turned, a silver wolf with a black lightning bolt between his eyes was creeping toward her, eyes red with anger, teeth exposed, growling, like he was ready for the kill.\u00a0 Fear and panic seized her whole being and she felt her legs and arms go stiff.\u00a0\u00a0 Her heart was beating so loud she thought it would drown out her very thoughts.\u00a0 She could not outrun the wolf and her mind was racing with random thoughts that offered no plan of escape.\u00a0 Tears started to trickle down her face; her mind telling her this was a horrific way to die.</p><p>Drib yelled at her \u201cRaise your arms and jump up to the bottom branch of the tree.\u201d</p><p>It was a large pine tree with the bottom branch at least six feet off the ground.\u00a0 She was small, and there was no way that she could jump that high.\u00a0 The adrenaline was racing and the wolf was getting closer.\u00a0 She heard \u201cJust JUMP.\u201d\u00a0 What happened next was like a dream \u2013 she found herself standing on the branch!\u00a0 She grabbed another branch in front of her to steady her balance while she tried to think.\u00a0 The wolf jumped with all his force hoping to reach the branch, but instead only made the tree swagger slightly.\u00a0 Elsa hung onto the branch with all her might.</p><p>How did she get from the ground into the tree?\u00a0 Was it merely the fear of being attacked by the wolf that had poured adrenaline into her body that allowed superhuman strength in her legs?\u00a0 Was it magic? Did she have an unknown guardian angel or fairy godmother that came to her aid in her time of need?\u00a0 Was Drib a magical bird and had the power to help her jump higher than humanly feasible? </p><p>She climbed up one more branch to put extra space between her and the wolf, which allowed her to gather her thoughts:\u00a0 \u201cDrib did you do this?\u201d</p><p>He replied \u201cNo, my child I do not possess that kind of power.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, a flash of black feathers swooped past her and flew straight into the wolf\u2019s forehead.\u00a0 The wolf snarled at its attacker, but Drib was quick and had already flown up, turned around, and was headed back down to attack again.\u00a0 After several failed attempts to catch Drib, and several good solid pecks to his head, the wolf yelped, and turned and ran off into the forest.</p><p>Elsie was too scared to move.\u00a0 After her heart slowed to its normal beat, she realized she needed to get going or she would be late getting home from Nan\u2019s house, and mother would be worried.\u00a0 She was also anxious to get far away from the wolf.\u00a0 She dropped her bag to the ground, and was going to slide off the limb as far as possible and then drop to the ground, hoping to break anything.\u00a0 As she was getting into position Drib said: \u201cJust jump down and see what your gift will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d she said.\u00a0 It is too far to the ground and I will surely break something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust your gifts.\u00a0 They got you up out of danger, so they can certainly bring you back down to safety,\u201d Drib offered.</p><p>Elsa thought, this is crazy, but nothing was logical about the last few minutes, and it seemed Drib knew more than she did, so she jumped.\u00a0 It was like a feather floating in the air gently lowering her to the ground.\u00a0 Her landing startled her so much she stood still for several seconds.</p><p>Drib interrupted her thoughts with a joyful song,</p><p>\u201c\u201cI have found one of the special ones!\u00a0I knew it, you are more than gifted \u2013 you can fly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is ridiculous.\u00a0 No one flies except the birds,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cI have waited all my life to see the prophesy fulfilled that one day there would be gifted ones who had talents beyond our imagination,\u201d Drib shared excitedly.</p><p>Elsa heard a rustle in the bushes and the fear of the returning wolf panicked her and she grabbed her bag and darted off through the remaining trail to Nana\u2019s house telling Drib</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get to grandmother\u2019s house and then back home before it gets late and mother starts to worry.\u201d</p><p>Drib flew behind her.\u00a0 When Nana opened the door she exclaimed \u201cElsa, whatever is the matter, you look like you\u2019ve just seen a ghost.\u00a0 Sit down and tell me what is the matter while you have some cookies and milk.</p><p>Elsa gladly sat in her chair at the kitchen table.\u00a0 On top of everything that just happened now she was overwhelmed with what she should tell grandmother. \u00a0If she told the real story and how she flew up in the tree to escape the wolf, grandmother would think she was crazy.\u00a0 Her parents would send her away or lock her up.\u00a0 She was scared and confused.</p><p>Grandmother sat down at the table beside her and said, \u201cOur friend, Drib, tells me something amazing happened.\u201d</p><p>Elsa looked up with big open eyes and said, \u201cOur friend \u2013 you can hear him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes my child, I also have gifts,\u201d grandmother said, \u201cand Drib is the very bird that helped me find them.\u00a0 But before we talk about me, let me hear your story.\u201d</p><p>Elsa told her about the wolf and Drib and when she looked up, grandmother had tears rolling down her face.\u00a0\u00a0 Grandmother enveloped Elsa in a reassuring hug and said:\u00a0 \u201cI never imagined that one of my grandchildren would be a special gifted one like me.\u00a0 This is the happiest day of my life and we have much to talk about.</p><p>Grandmother took Elsa in her arms and whispered in her ear \u201cWhen you were born I saw the aura of color around you and always knew you were gifted, but today, I see that you inherited my secret.\u00a0 I have never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>Elsa had so many questions she couldn\u2019t think straight, but she managed to say, \u201cAre mom and dad gifted, and do they know?\u201d\u00a0 .\u00a0 That is why I like living out here alone in the forest away from the village so I can use my gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn you were special, grandmother?\u201d\u00a0 Elsa asked as she consumed several cookies.</p><p>\u201cAs a little girl, I always felt like there was something different about me, but I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u00a0 I was much like you \u2013 timid, but talented.\u00a0 I had a connection with animals and thought this is what made me feel different than my friends.\u00a0 One day when I was slightly older than you, my mother and father went to the village to sell vegetables.\u00a0 They would not be back until dark and told me to do the gardening, light a fire under the pot of stew so it would be ready for dinner, and they would be back about the time it got dark.</p><p>I had done all my chores and was having a great time feeding bunnies and squirrels when suddenly I saw a silver wolf with a black lightening mark between his eyes hunched down, glaring at me with deathly red eyes.\u00a0 He was creeping straight toward me, teeth bared, growling so ferociously my body started to shake.\u00a0 All my forest friends scampered down their holes and I froze in my tracks thinking that my life was over.\u00a0 Suddenly I heard a voice in my mind say jump.\u00a0 I laughed out loud as I wasn\u2019t under a tree and there was nothing to jump to.\u00a0 But the voice shouted \u201cJUMP\u201d so I gathered all my strength and ended up on the roof of the house.\u00a0\u00a0 I sat down to calm my nerves and after a couple futile jumps, the wolf gave up and headed back into the forest.\u00a0 The sound of my heart beating finally quieted down so I could hear myself think.\u00a0 I sat perched on the roof for a long time trying to figure out what happened and how to get down.\u00a0 I wondered if it was magic and did I have a fairy godmother or a guardian angel that had somehow put me on the roof.\u00a0 I noticed the sun was starting it\u2019s descent toward dusk and I knew that if I didn\u2019t do something soon mother and father would be home and see me sitting on the roof.\u00a0 How would I ever explain how I got up there?\u00a0 They would never leave me alone again.\u00a0 Just then Drib landed on the roof next to me.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you jumped up here, just jump down,\u201d\u00a0 he said.</p><p>All could think was I\u2019ve gone crazy.\u00a0 I\u2019m hearing voices.\u00a0 Tears were streaming down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou are not crazy, you are a gifted one, and I\u2019m a watcher.\u00a0 My job is to help you use your special talents.\u00a0 Just trust yourself,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll break something ,\u201d I cried.</p><p>No you won\u2019t. \u00a0Just trust me,\u201d Drib pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYou flew up, so just sit on the edge of the roof and jump.\u00a0 Focus on floating to the ground and see what happens,\u201d Drib commanded.</p><p>Since I knew I was crazy I did as he said and to my astonishment I found myself standing on the ground.\u00a0 I felt like an autumn leaf gliding, floating downward to the ground.\u00a0 I said</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d but I was so scared about everything that had happened that I ran inside the house and locked the doors.\u00a0 I spent the next hour convincing myself I was ok and trying to get the panic off my face and get my body to relax so I would feel normal when my parents returned.\u00a0 I never told anyone what happened, but as I got older and could wander off alone I would experiment and learned how to control my movements.\u00a0 Drib was right.\u00a0 I can fly.</p><p>Drib jumped up and sang excitedly:\u00a0 \u201cBlessed me, I wondered what happened to you.\u00a0 How amazing that our lives have come full circle and our paths are again intertwined!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d grandmother said.\u00a0 \u201cIt is strange, or maybe mystical, that we both had our mystery revealed to us at the feet of a dangerous wolf and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no mystery about the wolf,\u201d Drib offered.\u00a0 \u201cHe is a special one that only appears when it is time for one of the prophetic special ones to learn who they are.\u00a0 Actually you were never in any danger, but you had to think you were or else you never would have followed my suggestions.\u00a0 My being present to witness this miracle with both of you, however, is providence and a special unexpected blessing for me.\u201d</p><p>Nancy grabbed Elsa\u2019s hands and said \u201ccome, let me show you something.\u201d\u00a0 When they reached the clearing past her flower garden she said \u201csit on the bench and watch carefully.\u201d</p><p>Elsa sat down and Drib perched on her shoulder.\u00a0 Then Nana was in the air, flying in circles above them.\u00a0 She eased herself down so she was standing facing them and grabbed Elsa\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn. I\u2019m going to hold your hand and not let go, but you need to let your brain go and just pretend you are a butterfly or a bird,\u201d Nana whispered softly,</p><p>When Nana took off, Elsa was hanging below her, but after a couple minutes, her body felt lighter and she found herself beside Nana, flying in circles with her.</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Nana said, \u201cEnough fun for today.\u00a0 We are going to circle lower until we can stand up and then float to the ground.\u00a0 Just relax and do what I do.\u00a0 Keep your body even with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nana, that was amazing,\u201d and with tears rolling down her cheeks, she cried, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy after all.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother raised Elsa\u2019s face up to hers and said, \u201cElsa, you and I, and Drib, if he decides to stick around, will have many long talks and fun adventures together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss this for anything.\u00a0 I\u2019ve waited my whole life for this!\u201d Drib exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cKeep our secret close to your heart.\u00a0 I\u2019ll teach you everything I have learned about my gifts and Drib can explain your role in protecting the nature you so love.\u00a0 But, right now,\u201d grandmother said, \u201cwe are getting you home.\u201d</p><p>They walked back through the forest in silence; grandmother holding Elsa\u2019s hand, Drib sitting on Elsa\u2019s shoulder; each consumed with their own dreams.\u00a0 Elsa with visions of her and Nana flying off to explore other parts of the world she had never seen, and meeting all of the Watchers!\u00a0 Nana, feeling ten years younger, sharing similar visions of teaching Elsa; rejoicing that she had been able to share her secret after so many years.\u00a0 Drib finding it difficult to contain his excitement envisioning the shock on the faces of the other members of the Watcher Society when he announced tonight that he had found two special gifted ones right here in Egalliv!</p><p>Life would never be the same for any of them.</p>"}
