SHEILA SPANGLE THE AMAZING CONTORTIONIST reads the sign on our caravan.</p><p>Papa\u2019s Herman the Mighty Magician. And my older brother Anthony is a trapeze artist.</p><p>I\u2019m Cassie, the Family Disappointment. Can\u2019t fold my body into a tiny ball. Can\u2019t produce coins from behind people\u2019s ears. And unlike Anthony, I\u2019m terrified of heights.</p><p>My only skill is I play the violin.</p><p>\u201cLike an angel,\u201d says Madam Zizinski, my music teacher.</p><p>\u201cLike a squawking bird,\u201d says Anthony.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a circus girl, Cassie,\u201d Mama says. \u201cCircus girls don\u2019t play the violin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a rare gift,\u201d says Madam Zizinkski.</p><p>I believe her. Between acts, she tells fortunes with her crystal ball.</p><p>After Tuesday night\u2019s show I\u2019m practising my music when the circus owner stands outside our van talking to Papa.</p><p>Usually Mr Sharman speaks with a cheerful voice. Tonight he sounds serious. \u00a0\u201cProfits are down,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m going to have to let some of our people go.\u2019</p><p>I wonder if Mr Sharman is going to sack our whole family. Then where would we go? The circus is our life.</p><p>Next day I find Madam in her van packing a suitcase.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Madam reaches out and draws me to her. \u00a0\u201cOh little one,\u201d she says in her heavy accent. \u201cI will miss you so much. Mr Sharman has given me my marching orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marching? Are you in a new act?\u201d</p><p>Madam smiles. \u201cNo, ma petite. I am leaving the circus.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too much! I burst into tears.</p><p>Madam croons soft and low in my ear as she rocks me.</p><p>\u201cI want to go with you,\u201d I blubber.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to visit my family in Europe,\u201d Madam says. \u201cIt is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d</p><p>Madam sighs. \u201cYou will be sad for a while. But, dearest Cassie, it will not last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it will. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Madam Zizinski slips me off her lap. \u201cLook, little one. Look into the ball.\u201d</p><p>When Madam peers into her crystal ball, she can see into the future.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she says. \u201cHere you are. I see many happy people around you.\u201d</p><p>I peer into the ball.\u00a0 \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a good place,\u201d says Madam. \u201cThe angel has played her music. And soothed the savage beast.\u201d</p><p>Next day I want to be happy. But I feel lost when Madam leaves.</p><p>Mama gives me Calipso, our youngest chimp. \u201cLook after her; like you would a baby.\u201d</p><p>Mr Sharman sold Calipso\u2019s mother to a zoo. I hug my new pet and mutter angry words about Mr Sharman.</p><p>Calipso pokes her fingers into my mouth. And up her nose. Even though he makes me laugh, I\u2019m still sad. I\u2019m even sadder when Mr Sharman sacks Shortie, the lion tamer.</p><p>\u201cHerman,\u201d the boss tells Papa, \u201cI want Cassie and Calipso to be part of your new act.\u201d</p><p>Papa has to teach Calipso tricks. I have to play the violin.</p><p>I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want to perform.\u00a0 My music isn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>That night, all night, our circus elephant Ellie trumpets. Nobody can sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShut that jumbo up,\u201d Mr Sharman tells Papa.</p><p>Papa talks softly to Ellie. But still she trumpets.</p><p>\u201cGo play her some music, Cassie,\u201d says Mama.</p><p>I grumble as it\u2019s cold outdoors, but do as I\u2019m told. I play a polka and then a waltz. Soon Ellie has calmed.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Papa, \u201cShe\u2019s dancing!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. Ellie\u2019s swaying in time with my music.</p><p>For the first time ever I don\u2019t feel like the Family Disappointment.</p><p>Mama fits Papa and me with colourful clown outfits. I have a red, plastic nose and a purple wig.</p><p>Calipso claps his hands and somersaults when he sees me. He curls back his lips and bobs his head up and down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, you naughty boy!\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019m so scared about performing. Mama hugs me. \u201cDo your best,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>In the Big Top the show goes on. Mama squashes herself in her jar. Then Anthony, so strong and handsome, flies on the trapeze.</p><p>I\u2019m on next.</p><p>\u201cPresenting Cassie, Calipso and Charlie, the Incredible Clowns!\u201d announces Mr Sharman.</p><p>The three of us hurtle into the ring. Papa and Calipso tumble while I play a cheerful tune. Then they chase one another while I play as fast as I can.</p><p>When I stop, Papa bellows, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He pulls a bunch of flowers out of a boy\u2019s ear.</p><p>It\u2019s a trick, of course. But the kid is amazed.</p><p>Calipso grabs Papa\u2019s flowers and races off. Papa chases him. I play again. My music is sweet and the people are swaying in time with it.</p><p>People love Calipso\u2019s antics. And Papa\u2019s magic. If only Madam Zizinski was here to hear me play. She\u2019d enjoy our act so much!</p><p>While we entertain, workers build a cage in the ring for the big cats.</p><p>When it\u2019s finished, Papa, Calipso and I bow and leave.</p><p>\u201cYou were wonderful, Cassie,\u201d says Mama, waiting in the wings.</p><p>Papa and I stay to watch the big cats. All day they\u2019ve been roaring, pacing up and down.</p><p>\u201cThey miss Shorty,\u201d says Papa. \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of them.\u201d</p><p>Down the chute the four of them go. Snarling and showing their razor- sharp teeth.</p><p>Sheila the tigress looks extra mean. She snaps at Mr Sharman. He bellows at her. Flicks his whip on her rump.</p><p>Now the lions are perched on their stands. When Mr Sharman tries to get Big Boy to jump through a hoop, he refuses.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d do it easy for Shorty,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>The audience starts a slow hand clap. Mr Sharman yells at Big Boy and whips him, hard.</p><p>In a flash Sheila leaps from her stand. She crashes into Mr Sharman and knocks him down.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d the audience cries.</p><p>Papa charges into the cage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, Papa!\u201d I scream.</p><p>Now Anthony is going in, too!</p><p>Papa grabs Mr Sharman\u2019s whip and flicks it at Sheila and Big Boy. Mr Sharman is lying still on the ground. People are screaming. Calipso has his hands over his eyes and is whimpering.</p><p>Sheila bares her teeth. Marcelle paces back and forth, roaring. \u00a0So do Big Boy and Roman. They\u2019ve never been so angry. So fierce. So scary.</p><p>I wish there was something I could do.</p><p>Then I remember: \u201cYou will sooth the savage beast,\u201d Madam Zizinski said.</p><p>I tuck my violin under my chin, raise my bow, and play the sweetest music I know.</p><p>Anthony pulls Mr Sharman to the cage door.</p><p>Papa is trying to herd the cats into the chute but they won\u2019t go. They don\u2019t seem to hear my music. For sure Sheila is going to leap onto Papa. Tear him to pieces.</p><p>Not one of the cats is doing what Papa tells them. Shorty would have sorted them out in a flash. But Papa has never worked the cats before. They\u2019re fierce and so, so mean.</p><p>I close my eyes and focus on my music. But the cats don\u2019t seem to hear it.</p><p>All alone, Papa is struggling for control. The cats bellow at him, refusing to do as he says.</p><p>Now, remembering how my music calmed Ellie, I start up a waltz. Da Da Da, Da Du Da Da!</p><p>Now Sheila comes to the side of the cage, roaring. I would like to yell at her to behave herself. But I need to concentrate on my tune.</p><p>One of Sheila\u2019s ears is raised. She looks straight at me. She hears my music!\u00a0 Marcelle, Big Boy and Roman are quiet now, too. The people are hushed. Papa\u2019s whiplash sizzles in the air.</p><p>I keep playing my waltz. Da Da Da, Da Du Da Da!\u00a0 The audience begins clapping in time. The spotlight swings onto me.</p><p>Sheila\u2019s tail slaps against the cage bars. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s clapping, too. When she growls, it\u2019s a good growl, a way of saying something nice. I smile at her.</p><p>Marcelle now plods towards the chute. Big Boy follows her. And Roman, too. Before they pass the door, each of them turns and growls, as though saying \u201cThank you, Cassie.\u2019</p><p>I want to cry and to thank them for being good.</p><p>Now only Sheila is left in the ring.</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl!\u201d Papa shouts.</p><p>As meekly as a kitten, Sheila pads over to the chute, turns, and growls kindly at me.</p><p>When her tail disappears, I stop playing and stretch my aching fingers. I\u2019ve never played so long before. Nor as good.</p><p>Papa closes the chute door, smiles at me and bows to the audience. People start clapping and foot-stamping and calling, \u201cCircus girl! Circus girl!\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re cheering me! Me, Cassie Spangle.</p><p>Papa grins. Mama sweeps me into her arms and hugs me. \u201cWell done, Cassie, well done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Anthony says.</p><p>Calipso claps.</p><p>\u201cBow,\u201d whispers Papa.</p><p>I bow.</p><p>Madam Zizinski would be so proud.</p>"}
